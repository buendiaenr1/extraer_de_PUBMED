TI  - Once-Weekly Semaglutide in Adolescents with Obesity.
PG  - 2245-2257
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2208601 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A once-weekly, 2.4-mg dose of subcutaneous semaglutide, a 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, is used to treat obesity in adults, but 
      assessment of the drug in adolescents has been lacking. METHODS: In this 
      double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled 
      adolescents (12 to <18 years of age) with obesity (a body-mass index [BMI] in the 
      95th percentile or higher) or with overweight (a BMI in the 85th percentile or 
      higher) and at least one weight-related coexisting condition. Participants were 
      randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 
      (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo for 68 weeks, plus lifestyle intervention. The 
      primary end point was the percentage change in BMI from baseline to week 68; the 
      secondary confirmatory end point was weight loss of at least 5% at week 68. 
      RESULTS: A total of 201 participants underwent randomization, and 180 (90%) 
      completed treatment. All but one of the participants had obesity. The mean change 
      in BMI from baseline to week 68 was -16.1% with semaglutide and 0.6% with placebo 
      (estimated difference, -16.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      -20.3 to -13.2; P<0.001). At week 68, a total of 95 of 131 participants (73%) in 
      the semaglutide group had weight loss of 5% or more, as compared with 11 of 62 
      participants (18%) in the placebo group (estimated odds ratio, 14.0; 95% CI, 6.3 
      to 31.0; P<0.001). Reductions in body weight and improvement with respect to 
      cardiometabolic risk factors (waist circumference and levels of glycated 
      hemoglobin, lipids [except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol], and alanine 
      aminotransferase) were greater with semaglutide than with placebo. The incidence 
      of gastrointestinal adverse events was greater with semaglutide than with placebo 
      (62% vs. 42%). Five participants (4%) in the semaglutide group and no 
      participants in the placebo group had cholelithiasis. Serious adverse events were 
      reported in 15 of 133 participants (11%) in the semaglutide group and in 6 of 67 
      participants (9%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Among adolescents with 
      obesity, once-weekly treatment with a 2.4-mg dose of semaglutide plus lifestyle 
      intervention resulted in a greater reduction in BMI than lifestyle intervention 
      alone. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; STEP TEENS ClinicalTrials.gov number,

AB  - Approximately 50 million children and adolescents in Latin America are affected 
      by the childhood obesity pandemic. We present the case of a 5-year-old Mexican 
      girl with obesity and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), in whom prenatal, 
      lifestyle and environmental risk factors were identified. Here, we demonstrate 
      how childhood obesity is rooted since pregnancy and the perinatal stage, and how 
      the social determinants of health like unsafe outdoor conditions, lack of 
      infrastructure to exercise and a suboptimal physical activity curriculum in 
      government schools strongly influence the development and maintenance of 
      childhood obesity and complicate management.

TI  - [Childhood obesity: current situation in Mexico].
PG  - 463-469
LID - 10.20960/nh.2116 [doi]
AB  - Mexico has reported in 2016 a combined prevalence of obesity and overweight of 
      33.2% in children. The objective of this work was to make a literature review of 
      the factors associated with obesity in Mexican children, such as genetic factors, 
      feeding patterns, sedentary lifestyle and gut microbiota. We found that in 
      Mexican children SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) is present in genes such as 
      MC4R, FTO and ADRB1, associated with obesity, and that PON-1192 polymorphism 
      increases the risk of suffering insulin resistance. On the other hand, the 
      variant of the ADIPOR2 gene (rs11061971) protects Mexican children against 
      obesity, as well as a greater number of copies of the AMY gene was found in 
      children with normal weight. The evidence of the number of copies is very 
      important, since the current diet of the Mexican population is rich in 
      carbohydrates and fats, origin of a nutritional transition that includes 
      sedentary activities and a high consumption of sugary drinks. The consumption of 
      certain foods causes important changes in the gut microbiota that contribute to 
      the development of obesity and insulin resistance. It has been found that Mexican 
      children with obesity have a higher abundance of phylum Firmicutes and B. 
      eggerhii bacteria. Therefore, as obesity is so diverse, it is essential to 
      diversify the treatment in which government authorities, parents and health 
      authorities should get involved, as well as reinforcing nutrition and healthy 
      eating issues in primary education in the country in order to reverse the 
      prevalence and prevent the development of other pathologies in Mexican children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of childhood obesity is an international public health 
      priority given the significant impact of obesity on acute and chronic diseases, 
      general health, development and well-being. The international evidence base for 
      strategies to prevent obesity is very large and is accumulating rapidly. This is 
      an update of a previous review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of a 
      range of interventions that include diet or physical activity components, or 
      both, designed to prevent obesity in children. SEARCH METHODS: We searched 
      CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO and CINAHL in June 2015. We re-ran the search 
      from June 2015 to January 2018 and included a search of trial registers. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet or physical 
      activity interventions, or combined diet and physical activity interventions, for 
      preventing overweight or obesity in children (0-17 years) that reported outcomes 
      at a minimum of 12 weeks from baseline. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors 
      independently extracted data, assessed risk-of-bias and evaluated overall 
      certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We extracted data on adiposity outcomes, 
      sociodemographic characteristics, adverse events, intervention process and costs. 
      We meta-analysed data as guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews 
      of Interventions and presented separate meta-analyses by age group for child 0 to 
      5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to 18 years for zBMI and BMI. MAIN RESULTS: We 
      included 153 RCTs, mostly from the USA or Europe. Thirteen studies were based in 
      upper-middle-income countries (UMIC: Brazil, Ecuador, Lebanon, Mexico, Thailand, 
      Turkey, US-Mexico border), and one was based in a lower middle-income country 
      (LMIC: Egypt). The majority (85) targeted children aged 6 to 12 years.Children 
      aged 0-5 years: There is moderate-certainty evidence from 16 RCTs (n = 6261) that 
      diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, 
      reduced BMI (mean difference (MD) -0.07 kg/m(2), 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      -0.14 to -0.01), and had a similar effect (11 RCTs, n = 5536) on zBMI (MD -0.11, 
      95% CI -0.21 to 0.01). Neither diet (moderate-certainty evidence) nor physical 
      activity interventions alone (high-certainty evidence) compared with control 
      reduced BMI (physical activity alone: MD -0.22 kg/m(2), 95% CI -0.44 to 0.01) or 
      zBMI (diet alone: MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.04; physical activity alone: MD 
      0.01, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.13) in children aged 0-5 years.Children aged 6 to 12 
      years: There is moderate-certainty evidence from 14 RCTs (n = 16,410) that 
      physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced BMI (MD -0.10 
      kg/m(2), 95% CI -0.14 to -0.05). However, there is moderate-certainty evidence 
      that they had little or no effect on zBMI (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02). There 
      is low-certainty evidence from 20 RCTs (n = 24,043) that diet combined with 
      physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced zBMI (MD -0.05 
      kg/m2, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.01). There is high-certainty evidence that diet 
      interventions, compared with control, had little impact on zBMI (MD -0.03, 95% CI 
      -0.06 to 0.01) or BMI (-0.02 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.06).Children aged 13 to 18 
      years: There is very low-certainty evidence that physical activity interventions, 
      compared with control reduced BMI (MD -1.53 kg/m2, 95% CI -2.67 to -0.39; 4 RCTs; 
      n = 720); and low-certainty evidence for a reduction in zBMI (MD -0.2, 95% CI 
      -0.3 to -0.1; 1 RCT; n = 100). There is low-certainty evidence from eight RCTs (n 
      = 16,583) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with 
      control, had no effect on BMI (MD -0.02 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.05); or zBMI (MD 
      0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.07; 6 RCTs; n = 16,543). Evidence from two RCTs 
      (low-certainty evidence; n = 294) found no effect of diet interventions on 
      BMI.Direct comparisons of interventions: Two RCTs reported data directly 
      comparing diet with either physical activity or diet combined with physical 
      activity interventions for children aged 6 to 12 years and reported no 
      differences.Heterogeneity was apparent in the results from all three age groups, 
      which could not be entirely explained by setting or duration of the 
      interventions. Where reported, interventions did not appear to result in adverse 
      effects (16 RCTs) or increase health inequalities (gender: 30 RCTs; socioeconomic 
      status: 18 RCTs), although relatively few studies examined these 
      factors.Re-running the searches in January 2018 identified 315 records with 
      potential relevance to this review, which will be synthesised in the next update. 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that include diet combined with physical 
      activity interventions can reduce the risk of obesity (zBMI and BMI) in young 
      children aged 0 to 5 years. There is weaker evidence from a single study that 
      dietary interventions may be beneficial.However, interventions that focus only on 
      physical activity do not appear to be effective in children of this age. In 
      contrast, interventions that only focus on physical activity can reduce the risk 
      of obesity (BMI) in children aged 6 to 12 years, and adolescents aged 13 to 18 
      years. In these age groups, there is no evidence that interventions that only 
      focus on diet are effective, and some evidence that diet combined with physical 
      activity interventions may be effective. Importantly, this updated review also 
      suggests that interventions to prevent childhood obesity do not appear to result 
      in adverse effects or health inequalities.The review will not be updated in its 
      current form. To manage the growth in RCTs of child obesity prevention 
      interventions, in future, this review will be split into three separate reviews 
      based on child age.

AB  - In the countries of Central America, South America and the Caribbean, there has 
      been a dramatic rise in obesity, the metabolic syndrome, hypertension and other 
      cardiovascular risk factors in the last few decades. Epidemiological evidence 
      highlights a consistent correlation between obesity and hypertension, and the 
      presence of obesity predisposes an individual to a greater risk of hypertension 
      although the mechanisms remain unclear. Obesity and hypertension are two key 
      drivers of the cardio-renal disease continuum, and patients with uncontrolled 
      cardiovascular risk in their mid-life will likely have an increased risk of 
      clinical cardiovascular and renal outcomes in old age. This article summarizes 
      the current status for the prevalence and consequences of obesity and 
      hypertension in Latin America, with the aim of initiating a call to action to all 
      stakeholders for greater implementation of primary prevention strategies, 
      particularly in the young.

AB  - INTRODUCCIÓN: Hasta ahora existen pocos estudios sobre las características 
      clínicas de la población pediátrica con neumonía por COVID-19. El objetivo de 
      este estudio fue analizar los datos que se asocian con el desarrollo de neumonía 
      en niños y adolescentes con infección por SARS-CoV-2 en México. MÉTODOS: Se llevó 
      a cabo un análisis secundario de la base de datos de la Dirección General de 
      Epidemiología del Gobierno Mexicano. Se incluyeron menores de 19 años con 
      infección por SARS-CoV-2 confirmada mediante la prueba de retrotranscripción 
      acoplada a la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (RT-PCR). La variable 
      dependiente fue el diagnóstico de neumonía. Se calcularon las razones de momios 
      (RM) y los intervalos de confianza del 95% (IC95%). Se realizaron modelos de 
      regresión logística múltiple para ajustar los factores asociados a neumonía. 
      RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 1443 niños con diagnóstico de COVID-19. La mediana de 
      edad de los participantes fue de 12 años (rango intercuartilar 25-75: 5-16). La 
      neumonía se presentó en 141 niños (9.8%). Los principales factores de riesgo 
      fueron edad < 3 años (RM: 3.5; IC95%: 2.45-5.03), diabetes u obesidad (RM: 12.6; 
      IC95%: 4.62-34.91) e inmunocompromiso (RM: 7.03; IC95%: 3.97-13.61). 
      CONCLUSIONES: Los niños con COVID-19 menores de 3 años y con comorbilidad, 
      especialmente diabetes u obesidad, y los inmunocomprometidos presentan mayor 
      riesgo de desarrollar neumonía. BACKGROUND: Currently, there are a few studies on 
      the clinical characteristics of the pediatric population with COVID-19 and 
      pneumonia. This study aimed to analyze data associated with the development of 
      pneumonia in children and adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout 
      Mexico. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the database of the 
      Dirección General de Epidemiología of the Mexican Government. We included 
      children under the age of 19 who were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by 
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The dependent 
      variable was the diagnosis of pneumonia. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence 
      intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Multiple logistic regression models were 
      performed to adjust factors associated with pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 1443 
      children with a COVID-19 diagnosis were included. The median age of the 
      participants was 12 years (interquartile range 25, 75: 5, 16). Pneumonia occurred 
      in 141 children (9.8%). The main risk factors were age < 3 years (OR, 3.5; 95%CI, 
      2.45-5.03); diabetes or obesity (OR, 12.6; 95%CI, 4.62-34.91); and 
      immunocompromise (OR, 7.03; 95%CI, 3.97-13.61). CONCLUSIONS: Children < 3 years 
      with COVID-19 and comorbidities, especially diabetes or obesity, and 
      immunocompromised patients have a higher risk of developing pneumonia.

TI  - Mediterranean-style diet reduces metabolic syndrome components in obese children 
      and adolescents with obesity.
PG  - 175

AB  - BACKGROUND: The beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet have been amply 
      proven in adults with cardiovascular risk factors. The effects of this diet have 
      not been extensively assessed in pediatric populations with obesity, insulin 
      resistance (IR) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of this study was to 
      assess the efficacy of the Mediterranean style diet (MSD) to decrease 
      cardiovascular risk factors in children and adolescents with obesity. METHODS: 
      Participants were randomly assigned to a MSD rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
      fiber, flavonoids and antioxidants (60% of energy from carbohydrate, 25% from 
      fat, and 15% from protein, (n = 24); or a standard diet (55% of carbohydrate, 30% 
      from fat and 15% from protein, (n = 25), the caloric ingest was individualized. 
      At baseline and 16-week of intervention, the glucose, triglycerides (TG), total 
      cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C were measured as well as the body composition and 
      anthropometric data. The diet compliance was determined by the 24-hour 
      recalls.Paired Student's t and Macnemar's test were used to compare effects in 
      biochemical, body composition, anthropometric, and dietary variables. RESULTS: 
      The MSD group had a significantly decrease in BMI, lean mass, fat mass, glucose, 
      TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C. (p < 0.05); the diet compliance increased consumption of 
      omega 9 fatty acids, zinc, vitamin E, selenium, and decreased consumption of 
      saturated fatty acids (p < 0.05). The standard diet group decrease in glucose 
      levels and frequency of glucose >100 mg/dL (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The MSD 
      improves the BMI, glucose and lipid profile in children and adolescents with 
      obesity and any MetS component.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify factors predicting 
      laboratory-positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric patients 
      with acute respiratory symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional 
      analysis of a prospective cohort study. METHODS: Data from 1849 individuals were 
      analyzed. COVID-19 was confirmed (reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase 
      chain reaction) in 15.9% of patients, and factors predicting a positive test 
      result were evaluated through prevalence odds ratios and 95% confidence 
      intervals. RESULTS: Increasing age, personal history of obesity, and household 
      contact with a case were found to be associated, in the multiple regression 
      model, with increased odds of a positive test result. Young patients residing in 
      areas with higher population sizes, as well as those with severe respiratory 
      symptoms, were less likely to be laboratory confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Early 
      identification and isolation of children and teenagers with suggestive symptoms 
      of COVID-19 is important to limit viral spread. We identified several factors 
      predicting the laboratory test result. Our findings are relevant from a public 
      health policy perspective, particularly after the restart of in-person academic 
      activities.

AB  - Objetivo. Cuantificar los cambios de sobrepeso y obesidad (SO+O) y determinar su 
      asociación con características sociodemográficas en escolares mexicanos de 
      primarias públicas durante 2015 y 2018. Material y métodos. Estudio transversal 
      comparativo. Se analizaron 6.5 millones de alumnos de 59 724 escuelas. La 
      información deriva del Registro Nacional de Peso y Talla (RNPT) en cuatro 
      periodos escolares, de 2015 a 2019, para niños de 6 a 12 años. Se estimaron 
      razones de momios (RM) y prevalencias ajustadas mediante regresión logística 
      ordinal generalizada. Resultados. Las RM fueron positivas para SO+O y para 
      obesidad en el sexo masculino, ámbito urbano y baja marginación (p<0.001). La 
      mayor prevalencia ajustada tanto para sobrepeso como para obesidad se reportó en 
      2016 (p<0.001). La región Sur manifestó ascensos constantes y significativos para 
      obesidad durante cuatro periodos. Conclusión. El RNPT permite detectar diversas 
      características de riesgo actual para el desarrollo de SO+O en escuelas primarias 
      del país.

TI  - CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS IN ADOLESCENTS: ROLE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AND 
      OBESITY.
PG  - 330-337
LID - 10.4183/aeb.2018.330 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Childhood obesity is a public health problem characterized by early 
      insulin resistance (IR), inflammation, and oxidative stress. The presence of an 
      uninterrupted low-grade inflammatory state impairs metabolic and cardiovascular 
      health. The population is particularly susceptible to develop metabolic disorders 
      related to increased body fat. METHODS: Eighty-three adolescents were recruited 
      and grouped according to HOMA-IR and BMI in either with or without IR and obese 
      or normal-weight respectively. Anthropometric, biochemical, immunological and 
      hormonal variables were determined. Transverse Analytical Study. RESULTS: 
      Obesity, dyslipidemia, IL-6, and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in 
      the IR group than in the non-IR group. Obese adolescents showed increased insulin 
      levels, HOMA-IR, inflammatory markers, and triglycerides; while having lower 
      HDL-C, and adiponectin when compared to normal-weight adolescents. As expected, 
      obesity-related anthropometric markers positively correlated with IR and 
      inflammatory markers while negatively correlated with adiponectin levels. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Early IR, subclinical inflammation, dyslipidemia, and 
      hypoadiponectinemia characterize obesity in adolescents. These factors may 
      increase the risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes mellitus 
      development (DM) in early adulthood.

      opportunities.

LID - 10.3402/gha.v9.29625 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mexico is a developing country with one of the highest youth obesity 
      rates worldwide; >34% of children and adolescents between 5 and 19 years of age 
      are overweight or obese. OBJECTIVES: The current review seeks to compile, 
      describe, and analyze dietary conditions, physical activity, socioeconomic 
      status, and cultural factors that create and exacerbate an obesogenic environment 
      among Mexican youth. DESIGN: A narrative review was performed using PubMed and 
      the Cochrane Library databases, as well as grey literature data from the Mexican 
      government, academics, and statistical reports from nongovernmental 
      organizations, included in electronic formats. RESULTS: The recent socioeconomic 
      and nutritional transition has resulted in reduced healthy meal options at public 
      schools, high rates of sedentary lifestyles among adolescents, lack of open 
      spaces and playgrounds, socioeconomic deprivation, false or misunderstood 
      sociocultural traditional beliefs, misconceptions about health, a high percentage 
      of overweight or obese adults, and low rates of maternal breastfeeding. Some of 
      the factors identified are exacerbating the obesity problem in this population. 
      Current evidence also shows that more policies and health programs are needed for 
      prevention of childhood and adolescent obesity. Mexico presents alarming obesity 
      levels, which need to be curtailed and urgently reversed. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present narrative review presents an overview of dietary, physical activity, 
      societal and cultural preconceptions that are potentially modifiable 
      obesity-promoting factors in Mexican youth. Measures to control these factors 
      need to be implemented in all similar developing countries by governments, policy 
      makers, stakeholders, and health care professionals to tackle obesity in children 
      and young people.

TI  - Bimodal distribution of risk for childhood obesity in urban Baja California, 
      Mexico.
PG  - 628-38

AB  - In Mexico, higher socioeconomic status (SES) has been found to be associated with 
      increased risk for obesity in children. Within developed urban areas, however, 
      there may be increased risk among lower SES children. Students in grades 4-6 from 
      five public schools in Tijuana and Tecate, Mexico, were interviewed and weight, 
      height and waist circumference (WC) measurements were taken. Interviews consisted 
      of questions on food frequency, food insecurity, acculturation, physical activity 
      and lifestyle practices. Multivariate logistic models were used to assess risk 
      factors for obesity (having a body mass index [BMI] ≥95th percentile) and 
      abdominal obesity (a WC >90th percentile) using Stata 11.0. Five hundred and 
      ninety students were enrolled; 43.7% were overweight or obese, and 24.3% were 
      obese and 20.2% had abdominal obesity. Independent risk factors for obesity 
      included watching TV in English (odds ratio [OR] 1.60, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 1.06-2.41) and perceived child food insecurity (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.05-2.36). 
      Decreased risk for obesity was associated with female sex (OR 0.64, 95% CI 
      0.43-0.96), as was regular multivitamin use (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42-0.94). Risk 
      obesity was also decreased with increased taco consumption (≥1×/week; OR 0.64, 
      95% CI 0.43-0.96). Independent risk factors for abdominal obesity included 
      playing video games ≥1×/week (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-2.96) and older age group 
      (10-11 years, OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.29-4.73 and ≥12 years, OR 2.21, 95% CI 
      1.09-4.49). Increased consumption of tacos was also associated with decreased 
      risk for abdominal obesity (≥1×/week; OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-1.00). We found a 
      bimodal distribution for risk of obesity and abdominal obesity in school aged 
      children on the Mexican border with the United States. Increased risk for obesity 
      and abdominal obesity were associated with factors indicative of lower and higher 
      SES including watching TV in English, increased video game playing and perceived 
      food insecurity. Increased consumption of tacos (≥1×/week) was associated with 
      decreased risk, possibly suggesting an association with children from middle 
      income families. Regular multivitamin use was protective and future studies may 
      focus on micronutrient supplementation as a means to prevent obesity in children 
      or further investigate factors associated with vitamin use. Additionally, future 
      studies need to examine the processes of acculturation on both sides of the 
      US-Mexican border that contribute to increased risk for obesity in children in 
      relation to SES.

TI  - Preventing childhood obesity in Latin America: an agenda for regional research 
      and strategic partnerships.
PG  - 3-6
LID - 10.1111/obr.12573 [doi]
AB  - The increasing prevalence of childhood obesity in Latin America poses a major 
      public health challenge to the region. In response, many countries are 
      implementing obesity prevention programmes aimed at modifying known risk factors. 
      However, the limited scientific evidence inhibits the development and 
      implementation of novel, effective interventions across the region. To address 
      these gaps, the NIH Fogarty International Center convened a workshop of 
      researchers, policymakers, programme implementers and public health advocates who 
      are actively engaged in the region to prevent childhood obesity. Major aims of 
      the meeting were to define the current status of childhood obesity, identify the 
      scientific gaps in our understanding of the epidemic, point out the barriers and 
      opportunities for research and outline a plan for capacity building in the region 
      in the area of childhood obesity. This series of articles reflects the key 
      outcome of the meeting and offers an analysis of the knowledge translation needed 
      for evidence-based policy initiatives, a review of the research agenda and an 
      evaluation of research capacity in the region. The goal of the papers is to 
      inform the development of multidisciplinary and multisector research 
      collaborations, which are essential to the implementation of successful childhood 
      obesity prevention strategies in the region.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze risk factors associated with overweight and obesity (OW+O) 
      among female Mexican teenagers (12 to 19 years old). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Secondary analysis of 1 072 teenagers from the Halfway National Survey of Health 
      and Nutrition (Ensanut MC, 2016). Ordinal logistic regression models were used to 
      estimate the association between OW+O and screen time, living with adults with 
      OW+O, marital union, and dietary patterns, among others. RESULTS: OW+O in 
      adolescents was higher when living with overweighed and obese adults (OR= 2.13), 
      >2 hours of screen time (OR= 2.5), discretionary food consumption pattern (OR= 
      1.81), living in marital union (OR = 2.13), classified in the highest tertile of 
      household wealth index (OR= 1.86), work and doing housework (OR= 5.4). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The most important risk factors associated with OW+O in Mexican 
      teenagers were related to family factors and lifestyles.

PG  - 187-93
LID - S0212-16112011000100022 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of maternal migration to Baja California, 
      body mass index (BMI) status, children's perceived food insecurity, and childhood 
      lifestyle behaviors with overweight (BMI > 85% ile), obesity (BMI > 95% ile) and 
      abdominal obesity (Waist Circumference > 90% ile). METHODS: Convenience sampling 
      methods were used to recruit a cross-sectional sample of 4th, 5th and 6th grade 
      children and their parents at Tijuana and Tecate Public Schools. Children's and 
      parents' weights and heights were measured. Children were considered to have 
      migrant parents if parents were not born in Baja California. RESULTS: One hundred 
      and twenty-two children and their parents were recruited. The mean age of the 
      children was 10.1 ± 1.0 years. Forty nine per cent of children were overweight or 
      obese. Children with obese parents (BMI > 30) had greater odds of being obese, 
      Odds Ratio (OR) 4.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.2-19, p = 0.03). Children 
      with migrant parents had greater odds of being obese, OR= 3.7 (95% CI, 1.6-8.3), 
      p = 0.01) and of having abdominal obesity, OR = 3.2 (95% CI, 1.4-7.1, p = 0.01). 
      Children from migrant parents have greater risk of higher consumption of potato 
      chips, OR = 8.0 (95% CI, 2.1-29.1, p = 0.01). Children from non-migrant parents 
      had greater odds of being at risk of hunger. CONCLUSIONS: Parental obesity and 
      migration are associated with increased risk of obesity among Mexican children. 
      Children whose parents were born in Baja California have greater odds of being at 
      risk of hunger. Further studies should evaluate the role of migration on risk for 
      childhood obesity.

TI  - Obesity increases metabolic syndrome risk factors in school-aged children from an 
      urban school in Mexico city.
PG  - 81-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the nutritional status of school-aged children from an 
      urban public school in Mexico City, Mexico, and to assess the influence of 
      obesity on health status in a subgroup of these children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      descriptive study. A nutrition screening was done for all children, including 
      anthropometric (ie, weight, height, and waist circumference) and blood pressure 
      assessment. In the subgroup of children, complementary dietary and biochemical 
      assessment (ie, glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, insulin, albumin, hemoglobin, 
      and hematocrit levels) was done. SUBJECTS: Children from an urban school in 
      Mexico City (N=561) aged 6 to 13 years. The representative subgroup (n=88) was 
      selected based on age (9 to 12 years) and weight status (ie, normal, overweight, 
      or obese). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics, correlations, mean 
      differences tests (analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U), and 
      chi(2) tests (categorical variables) were done with SPSS version 13 (2005, SPSS 
      Inc, Chicago, IL). RESULTS: In the whole school, overweight and obesity 
      prevalence were 27.1% and 21.4%, respectively. High systolic blood pressure was 
      seen in 8.4% of children and 6.2% of children had prehypertension. Higher 
      hypertension risk was seen in children with body mass index > or =95th percentile 
      and waist circumference > or =90th percentile (88 cm). Significantly higher waist 
      circumference, systolic blood pressure, insulin resistance indexes, and 
      triglyceride levels were found among the obese when compared with normal-weight 
      children. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood obesity prevalence is high in Mexico and it is 
      having an influence on children's health. It is urgent to design, implement, and 
      evaluate specific childhood obesity prevention programs.

AB  - Obesity is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as 
      diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. The worldwide prevalence of 
      obesity has almost doubled between 1980 and 2008. In some regions, such as 
      Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Americas, more than 50% of women are 
      overweight. Tonga, Nauru and the Cook Islands show the highest prevalence of 
      obesity worldwide, above 60% in men and in women. China and the United States are 
      the countries that experienced the largest absolute increase in the number of 
      overweight and obese people between 1980 and 2008, followed by Brazil and Mexico. 
      The regions with the largest increase in the prevalence of female obesity were 
      Central Latin America, Oceania and Southern Latin America. Updated data provide 
      evidence that the progression of the epidemic has effectively slowed for the past 
      ten years in several countries. In low-income countries obesity is generally more 
      prevalent among the better-off, while disadvantaged groups are increasingly 
      affected as countries grow. Many studies have shown an overall socio-economic 
      gradient in obesity in modern industrialized societies. Rates tend to decrease 
      progressively with increasing socio-economic status. Children obesity rates in 
      Spain are amongst the highest in the OECD. One in 3 children aged 13 to 14 are 
      overweight. Overweight in infants and young children is observed in the upper 
      middle-income countries. However, the fastest growth occurs in the group of lower 
      middle-income countries. There is a growing body of evidence for an inverse 
      association between SES and child obesity in developed countries. The prevalence 
      of overweight and obesity is high in all age groups in many countries, but 
      especially worrying in children and adolescents in developed countries and 
      economies in transition.

PG  - 533-9
LID - 10.1007/s10903-011-9553-7 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have found increased acculturation to the US lifestyle increases 
      risk for obesity in Latinos. However, methodologies differ, and results in 
      children are inconsistent. Moreover, previous studies have not evaluated risk 
      factors within the heterogeneous US population. We recruited 144 self-identified 
      Latino school children and their mother or father in grades 4-6 in San Francisco 
      parochial schools and South San Francisco public schools using an information 
      letter distributed to all students. Children and parents had weights, heights, 
      demographic information, dietary patterns and lifestyle variables collected in 
      English or Spanish through an interview format. A high percentage of our children 
      were overweight [≥85th percentile body mass index (BMI)] (62.5%) and obese (≥95th 
      percentile BMI) (45.2%). Correspondingly parents also had a high percentage of 
      overweight (BMI ≥ 25 & <30) (40.8%) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) (45.3%). Mexico was 
      the country of origin for 62.2% of parents, and 26.6% were from Central or South 
      America. In multivariate logistic analysis, speaking Spanish at home was an 
      independent risk factor for obesity [odds ratio (OR) 2.97, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 1.28-6.86]. Eating breakfast daily (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15-0.78) and 
      consumption of tortas (a Mexican fast food sandwich) (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-1.00) 
      were associated with decreased risk. In stratified analysis, significant 
      differences in risk factors existed between Mexican origin versus Central/South 
      American Latino children. The processes of acculturation likely impact eating and 
      lifestyle practices differentially among Latino groups. Interventions should 
      focus on ensuring that all children eat a nutritious breakfast and take into 
      consideration ethnicity when working with Latino populations.

TI  - Nutrition status of children in Latin America.
PG  - 7-18
LID - 10.1111/obr.12571 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rapidly increasing among Latin 
      American children, posing challenges for current healthcare systems and 
      increasing the risk for a wide range of diseases. To understand the factors 
      contributing to childhood obesity in Latin America, this paper reviews the 
      current nutrition status and physical activity situation, the disparities between 
      and within countries and the potential challenges for ensuring adequate nutrition 
      and physical activity. Across the region, children face a dual burden of 
      undernutrition and excess weight. While efforts to address undernutrition have 
      made marked improvements, childhood obesity is on the rise as a result of diets 
      that favour energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and the adoption of a sedentary 
      lifestyle. Over the last decade, changes in socioeconomic conditions, 
      urbanization, retail foods and public transportation have all contributed to 
      childhood obesity in the region. Additional research and research capacity are 
      needed to address this growing epidemic, particularly with respect to designing, 
      implementing and evaluating the impact of evidence-based obesity prevention 
      interventions.

TI  - [Modifiable risk factors in adolescents with obesity].
PG  - 312-327
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a stage of growth with changes whose result is 
      adulthood. Obesity increases the risk of chronic diseases; therefore, it is 
      important to identify modifiable risk factors to prevent obesity in adolescents. 
      OBJECTIVE: To iIdentify modifiable risk factors for obesity in adolescents from a 
      Family Medicine Unit in the city of Puebla. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Case-control 
      study. The Graffar scale, the World Health Organization percentile tables, the 
      Krece Plus test and the Short Diet Quality Screener (sDQS) were applied. Chi 
      squared, odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and Pearson's 
      phi with Cramer's V were used. RESULTS: 348 adolescents participated, divided 
      into 2 groups. In the group of adolescents with obesity, exclusive breastfeeding 
      was present in 44.8%, 60.9% had at least one obese parent, 66.7% had an 
      inadequate diet, and 63.8% had a bad lifestyle. On the other hand, the group of 
      adolescents without obesity presented exclusive breastfeeding in 88.5%, 75.3% did 
      not have parents with obesity, 66.1% presented an adequate diet in some aspects 
      and 52.3% had a fair to good lifestyle. CONCLUSION: The absence of exclusive 
      breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life, parental obesity, poor physical 
      activity, and inadequate diets were associated with the presence of obesity in 
      adolescents.

TI  - A Review of the Increasing Prevalence of Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease 
      (MAFLD) in Children and Adolescents Worldwide and in Mexico and the Implications 
      for Public Health.
PG  - e934134
LID - 10.12659/MSM.934134 [doi]
AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects almost a quarter of the world's 
      population and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children and 
      adolescents. The recent proposal to replace the terminology of NAFLD with 
      metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) aims to reflect the 
      pathophysiology and risk factors for this disease. Importantly, the risk factors 
      for MAFLD may be prenatal, such as genetic factors, or postnatal, such as obesity 
      and insulin resistance. MAFLD is increasingly recognized in children and 
      adolescents. Early diagnosis and identification of high-risk individuals with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome is important. The diagnosis and 
      management of MAFLD in children and adolescents should follow international 
      clinical guidelines, such as those from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 
      and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD). 
      Current guidelines recommend lifestyle and dietary modifications, exercise, 
      screening, individualized patient assessment, and multidisciplinary patient 
      management. This review assesses the revised terminology and discusses the 
      epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prevention of MAFLD 
      in children and adolescents worldwide and in Mexico, and also considers the 
      implications for public health.

TI  - Myokine-adipokine cross-talk: potential mechanisms for the association between 
      plasma irisin and adipokines and cardiometabolic risk factors in Mexican children 
      with obesity and the metabolic syndrome.
PG  - 63
LID - 10.1186/s13098-019-0458-2 [doi]
LID - 63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adipokines and the myokine irisin, involved in mechanisms associated 
      with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS), are understudied in the pediatric 
      population. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between irisin, and 
      leptin, resistin, adiponectin, adipsin, anthropometric and cardiovascular risk 
      factors in Mexican children. METHODS: A cross-sample of 126 Mexican children aged 
      6-12 years old were classified as normal weight (n = 46), obese (n = 40), and MS 
      (n = 40) according to CDC's and Cook's age-modified criteria for obesity and MS. 
      Anthropometric parameters and blood pressure were determined and percentiles 
      calculated for age and gender. Irisin, leptin, adiponectin, adipsin, resistin, 
      triglycerides, glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels, and 
      physical activity were determined. Statistical tests for differences between 
      groups, correlation, and multiple regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: 
      Irisin plasma levels were significantly lower in the obese (6.08 [4.68-6.65]) and 
      MS groups (6.46 [5.74-7.02]) compared with the normal-weight group (8.05 
      [7.24-8.94]) (p < 0.001). Irisin levels were not influenced by age or gender, but 
      significant dispersion was observed in obese girls (95% CI median [2.29-6.30]). 
      Leptin, resistin, and adipsin levels were significantly increased in the obese 
      and MS groups. Lean-fat ratio was significantly higher in the NW group. Irisin 
      correlated negatively with leptin (- 0.310), resistin (- 0.389), adipsin 
      (- 0.362), BMI% (-0.472), WC% (- 0.453), BMI z-score (- 0.496), fat free mass 
      (- 0.257), fat percentage (- 0.532), fat mass (- 0.515), triglycerides (- 0.291), 
      the number of cardiometabolic risk factors (- 0.443) (p < 0.001); positively with 
      lean-fat ratio (0.489) and HDL-c (0.328) (p < 0.001) and none with physical 
      activity (p < 0.001). Following stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, the 
      lean-fat ratio was the only determinant of irisin levels (B = 1.168, p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Lean-fat ratio, more than the absolute amount of muscle or fat mass, 
      as well as potential myokine-adipokine cross-talk mechanisms may explain the 
      lower irisin levels in children with obesity and MS, through blunted compensatory 
      responses interfering with tissue-dependent irisin secretion, contributing to a 
      continuous deleterious effect cycle.

AB  - Rapidly changing dietary practices accompanied by an increasingly sedentary 
      lifestyle predispose to nutrition-related non-communicable diseases, including 
      childhood obesity. Over the last 5 y, reports from several developing countries 
      indicate prevalence rates of obesity (inclusive of overweight) >15 % in children 
      and adolescents aged 5-19 y; Mexico 41.8 %, Brazil 22.1 %, India 22.0 % and 
      Argentina 19.3 %. Moreover, secular trends also indicate an alarming increase in 
      obesity in developing countries; in Brazil from 4.1 % to 13.9 % between 1974 and 
      1997; in China from 6.4 % to 7.7 % between 1991 and 1997; and in India from 4.9 % 
      to 6.6 % between 2003-04 to 2005-06. Other contributory factors to childhood 
      obesity include: high socio-economic status, residence in metropolitan cities and 
      female gender. Childhood obesity tracks into adulthood, thus increasing the risk 
      for conditions like the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 
      polycystic ovarian syndrome, hypertension, dyslipidemia and coronary artery 
      disease later in life. Interestingly, prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 
      35.2 % among overweight Chinese adolescents. Presence of central obesity (high 
      waist-to-hip circumference ratio) along with hypertriglyceridemia and family 
      history of T2DM increase the odds of T2DM by 112.1 in young Asian Indians (< 40 
      y). Therapeutic lifestyle changes and maintenance of regular physical activity 
      are most important strategies for preventing childhood obesity. Effective health 
      awareness educational programs for children should be immediately initiated in 
      developing countries, following the successful model program in India (project 
      'MARG').

TI  - High Relative Abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri and Fructose Intake are 
      Associated with Adiposity and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Children from 
      Mexico City.
LID - 10.3390/nu11061207 [doi]
LID - 1207
AB  - In Mexico, 3 of 10 children are overweight. Fructose intake and relative 
      abundance (RA) of Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) in the intestinal microbiota 
      are associated with obesity and diabetes in adults, but studies in children are 
      limited. This study evaluates the association between fructose intake and L. 
      reuteri RA with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk markers in Mexican children 
      dietary information, microbiota profiles, adiposity indicators (Body Mass Index, 
      BMI and Waste Circumference, WC), and cardiometabolic markers were analyzed in 
      1087 children aged 6-12 years. Linear regression and path analysis models were 
      used. High-tertile fructose intake and L. reuteri RA were positively associated 
      with BMI (β(Tertil 3 vs. Tertil 1) = 0.24 (95% CI, 0.04; 0.44) and β(T3 vs. T1) = 
      0.52 (95% CI, 0.32; 0.72)) and WC (β(T3 vs. T1) = 2.40 (95% CI, 0.93; 3.83) and 
      β(T3 vs. T1) = 3.40 (95% CI, 1.95; 4.90)), respectively. Also, these factors 
      mediated by adiposity were positively correlated with high triglycerides and 
      insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR (p ≤ 0.03) and negatively associated with 
      HDL-C concentration (p < 0.01). High-tertile fructose intake and L. reuteri RA 
      were directly associated with adiposity and indirectly associated though 
      adiposity with metabolic disorders in children. In conclusion, fructose intake 
      and L. reuteri RA were directly associated with adiposity and indirectly 
      associated with metabolic disorders in children, mediated by adiposity.

TI  - Social and Health Risk Factor Levels of Preschool Children Living Along the 
      Texas-Mexico Border.
LID - 10.1111/josh.12979 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is a public health concern that disproportionately 
      affects populations from low socioeconomic status (SES) and minority groups. 
      Evaluation of social and health risk factors of preschool children living along 
      the Texas-Mexico border provides feedback to design health interventions. 
      METHODS: South Texas Early Prevention Study-PreK (STEPS-PreK) is a cluster 
      randomized trial designed to assess the effect of the Bienestar coordinated 
      school health program on children's health outcomes. Family characteristics, 
      dietary intake, fitness, and anthropometric data were collected from 1277 
      preschool students enrolled in 28 preschools. RESULTS: The response rate was 67%. 
      Overall, 57% of families lived in poverty. The mean age of students was 
      4.7 years, 95% were Hispanic, and 51% were male. The average serving of fruits 
      and vegetables per day were 1 and 1/3, respectively. Of these, students consumed 
      39.7% of fruits and 18.9% of vegetables. Obesity prevalence for boys was 19.2% 
      and for girls 16.8%. Nearly one-half reported some form of food insecurity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Children living in low-income areas are affected by high levels of 
      social and health risk factors. It is these families who should be targeted with 
      early-age and culturally appropriate health programs.

AB  - Increases in the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), particularly 
      cardiometabolic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, stroke and diabetes, and 
      their major risk factors have not been uniform across settings: for example, 
      cardiovascular disease mortality has declined over recent decades in high-income 
      countries but increased in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The factors 
      contributing to this rise are varied and are influenced by environmental, social, 
      political and commercial determinants of health, among other factors. This Review 
      focuses on understanding the rise of cardiometabolic diseases in LMICs, with 
      particular emphasis on obesity and its drivers, together with broader 
      environmental and macro determinants of health, as well as LMIC-based responses 
      to counteract cardiometabolic diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examines links between early life circumstances and adult 
      socioeconomic status and obesity and hypertension in the adult Mexican 
      population. METHOD: We use data from the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS) 
      collected in 2002 for people aged 20 or older (N = 14,280). RESULTS: We found 
      that men with low education and women with more education have significantly 
      lower obesity. Women with higher education also have significantly less 
      hypertension. Obesity triples the likelihood of hypertension among both men and 
      women. Better childhood experiences are associated with less hypertension among 
      women, but more hypertension among men in rural areas. DISCUSSION: Recent changes 
      in income, nutrition, and infection in Mexico may be responsible for the observed 
      high prevalence of overweight and obesity and the extremely high odds of 
      hypertension among obese young adults.

TI  - Frequency and Risk Factors of Kidney Alterations in Children and Adolescents who 
      Are Overweight and Obese in a Primary Health-care Setting.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity is clearly associated to kidney disease in adult population; 
      however, there is scarce evidence in children and adolescents. The aim was to 
      compare frequency of renal damage according to the presence of overweight-obesity 
      in children and adolescents, as well as to compare nutritional and biochemical 
      risk factors, according to the presence of kidney alterations. METHODS: 
      Cross-sectional study; 172 children and adolescents, 6-16 years old, without 
      malnutrition, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and independent comorbid conditions 
      associated to obesity or kidney disease, as well as transitory causes of 
      microalbuminuria (MA) from a Primary Health-Care Unit were included. Clinical, 
      biochemical, anthropometric and dietetic evaluations were measured in all 
      subjects; subsequently they were classified as normal weight, overweight and 
      obesity groups according to sex- and age-adjusted body mass index (BMI). 
      Glomerular filtration rate (GFR, estimated by Schwartz equation) and albuminuria 
      (albumin/creatinine ratio) were determined. Presence of kidney alterations was 
      measured as decreased GFR (<90 mL/min/1.73m(2)), hyperfiltration 
      (>170 mL/min/1.73m(2)) and MA (30-300 mg/g). RESULTS: Compared with controls, 
      subjects with overweight-obesity had significantly (P<.05) abdominal obesity (0 
      vs 69%), hypertension (19 vs 26%), hypertriglyceridemia (11 vs 47%), high 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (2 vs 8%) and low high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol; 2 vs 28%), hyperuricemia (11 vs 28%) and 
      hyperinsulinemia (8 vs 70%). Hyperfiltration and MA were present in 5 and 4 
      subjects with overweight/obesity, respectively, whereas decreased GFR was present 
      in only 1 subject with obesity. Normal weight subjects had no kidney alterations. 
      In multivariate analysis, kidney alterations were significantly predicted by 
      higher BMI and lower HDL-cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney alterations were 
      observed only in subjects with overweight (3.6%) and obesity (9.9%), who 
      additionally, displayed cardiometabolic and kidney disease risk factors more 
      frequently than normal weight subjects.

TI  - Infant and toddlers' feeding practices and obesity amongst low-income families in 
      Mexico.
PG  - 316-23
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of childhood obesity 
      among infants and toddlers from low-income families from three cities in Mexico. 
      This is a cross-sectional study of mothers and their infants and toddlers 
      attending a vaccination centre at three primary care clinics in Tijuana, Tuxtla, 
      and Reynosa. Anthropometric measurements of the mothers and children were 
      conducted at the clinic and a questionnaire was administered to the mother. 
      Eight-hundred and ten mothers and their 5 to 24 months old infants participated 
      in the study. Average age for the mothers was 24 (21-28) years, and 57% of them 
      were either overweight or obese. The children's average age was 12.7 (5-24) 
      months. Overall overweight prevalence in this sample was 11% and obesity 8%, 
      these increased with age, from 3% for overweight and 6 % for obesity before 6 
      months, to 13 and 10% between 12 to 24 months respectively. Thirty-five percent 
      of infants were breastfed>or=6 month and 92% were introduced to other solid foods 
      before 6 months. Introduction of high-fat content snacks (HFS) and carbonated and 
      non-carbonated sweetened (CSD) drinks starts before 6 months and more than sixty 
      percent of the children between 12 to 24 months of age were eating HFS and CSD 
      sweetened drinks at least once a week. Consumption of snacks and CSD sweetened 
      drinks (>or=1 week) was associated with being overweight and obese (crude), OR, 
      1.82; 95% CI=1.24-2.65 (p=0.002). These results suggest that preventive programs 
      should be initiated during pregnancy and continued.

TI  - Obesity risk factors in the ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in 
      Childhood) in Mexico City.
PG  - 141-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) 
      has promoted surveys in asthma and allergic diseases using standardized 
      methodologies including validated questionnaires. Many items in the 
      questionnaires have also been implied in the overweight and obesity etiology. 
      OBJECTIVE: To describe the factors associated with obesity in subjects of 6-7 
      years and 13-14 years in the ISAAC survey in Mexico City. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Data were obtained from questionnaires of children participating in a phase 3b 
      ISAAC survey. Logistic regression was used to determine the obesity risks 
      factors. RESULTS: The factors related to obesity were weekly consumption of meat 
      (+, positive relationship), vegetables, pasta, rice (+) and quartiles of birth 
      weight (+) in boys of 6-7 years. Having suffered eczema at any time, weekly 
      consumption of fruit, pasta, butter, nuts, potato (+), fast food (+), daily TV 
      viewing (+) in girls of 6-7years. Having suffered eczema at any time, weekly 
      consumption of pasta (+), butter, potato, weekly physical exercise in boys of 
      13-14 years; weekly consumption of pasta, margarine, milk, fast food (+), 
      currently smoking in girls of 13-14 years. CONCLUSIONS: There were not common 
      factor patterns for the different groups, birth weight, fast food, TV viewing and 
      lack of exercise have been previously related to pediatric obesity. Asthma was 
      not associated with a higher risk of obesity but medical history of eczema was 
      associated with lower risk of obesity in the 6-7 years girls, and 13-14 years 
      boys. The present study provides the bases for future epidemiological studies and 
      gives some clues on possible public health actions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood adversities are prevalent worldwide and might affect adult 
      cardiovascular health. However, in middle-income countries such as Mexico, 
      research on the impact of childhood adversities on cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
      in adulthood is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of adverse 
      childhood experiences (ACEs) and their association with risk factors for CVD in 
      adult Mexican women. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study population comprised 
      9853 women from the Mexican Teachers´ Cohort. METHODS: Participants responded to 
      an online questionnaire including a 10-item instrument on ACEs and questions on 
      CVD risk factors, between 2014 and 2017. Multivariate logistic regression models 
      were used to evaluate the association between ACEs and adult behavioral and 
      medical CVD risk factors. RESULTS: About 61% of participants reported at least 
      one ACE and 14% reported four or more. After multivariable adjustment, women who 
      reported ≥4 ACEs had 58% (95%CI 1.37, 1.81) higher odds of having ever smoked and 
      17% (95%CI 0.69, 0.99) lower odds of being physically active, compared with women 
      who reported no ACEs. Women who reported ≥4 ACEs also had higher odds of 
      hypertension (OR = 1.19; 95%CI 1.00, 1.43), diabetes (OR = 1.49; 95%CI 1.13, 
      1.96), high cholesterol (OR = 1.49; 95%CI 1.26, 1.75), and obesity (OR = 1.37; 
      95%CI 1.19, 1.57). In addition, individual ACE components were independently 
      associated with several CVD risk factors. CONCLUSION: ACEs are common and 
      associated with CVD risk factors in adult Mexican women.

TI  - Impact of environmental and individual factors on COVID-19 mortality in children 
      and adolescents in Mexico: An observational study.
PG  - 100184

LID - 100184
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the Covid-19 pandemic, children and adolescents faced poverty, 
      potentially dying from preventable causes, or missing out essential vaccines. The 
      aim of this study was to assess potential environmental and individual factors 
      associated to COVID-19 mortality in children and adolescents in Mexico. METHODS: 
      This cross-sectional study analysed the official data of 131,001 children under 
      10 years of age and adolescents between 10 and 19 years of age with COVID-19 
      disease, in Mexico. Participants were diagnosticated between March 2020 and June 
      13, 2021. The environmental variables such as malnutrition, vaccination coverage 
      and social lag index were evaluated at the state level. Multilevel models were 
      fitted to evaluate the association between environmental and individual factors 
      and COVID-19 mortality. FINDINGS: A total of 773 (0.6%) children and adolescents 
      died due to COVID-19. Younger age (OR = 0.878, 95%CI: 0.869-0.888), diabetes 
      (OR = 3.898, 95%CI: 2.596-5.851), immunosuppression (OR = 5.410, 95%CI: 
      4.088-7.158), obesity (OR = 1.876, 95%CI: 1.397-2.521), hypertension (OR = 1.906, 
      95%CI: 1.239-2.932), cardiovascular disease (OR = 2.288, 95%CI: 1.482-3.531), and 
      chronic kidney disease (OR = 13.250, 95%CI: 9.066-19.350) were associated with 
      mortality. COVID-19 mortality was directly associated with social lag index and 
      malnutrition (OR(very high) = 2.939, 95%CI: 1.111-7.775, and OR = 1.390, 95%CI: 
      1.073-1.802, respectively), and inversely associated with population density 
      (OR = 0.374, 95%CI: 0.204-0.688). Finally, children and adolescents living in 
      areas with a higher percentage of people with incomplete education (OR = 1.045, 
      95%CI: 1.011-1.081), of children of school age of 6-14 years who do not attend 
      school (OR = 1.266, 95%CI: 1.032-1.554), and of illiterate population aged 15 and 
      over (OR = 1.086, 95%CI: 0.999-1.179) were associated with a higher risk of 
      COVID-19 mortality. INTERPRETATION: Malnutrition, social lag index and population 
      density are key factors to understand COVID-19 mortality in children and 
      adolescents. Also, age and pre-existing comorbidities were also associated with 
      worse COVID-19 prognosis. FUNDING: No funding was secured for this study.

PG  - 289-295
AB  - Long-term childhood cancer survivors are at great risk of developing late adverse 
      effects after treatment, such as, reduced growth, obesity, decreased fertility, 
      high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, impaired glucose, another form of 
      cancer, among others organ dysfunctions, some of them are part of the metabolic 
      syndrome. Metabolic syndrome and cancer connection is still not entirely 
      understood, but there are some notions about it. Metabolic alterations produced 
      during childhood cancer are more likely determined by treatments like 
      radiotherapy, chemotherapy, glucocorticoids therapy, and surgery. Cancer 
      treatment is associated to vascular alterations, hormone deficiencies, changes in 
      insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory mediators. Obesity has 
      been considered a crucial component in metabolic syndrome; obesity risk factors 
      during childhood cancer include cranial radiation, female gender, and exposure to 
      glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone. In addition, local radiotherapy or surgery 
      may cause endocrine deficiencies, depends on the directly damage of endocrine 
      organs. Patients who received some types of cancer treatment should be evaluated 
      periodically to early diagnostic metabolic disorders associated to antineoplastic 
      therapy.

TI  - Prenatal phthalate exposure associated with age-specific alterations in markers 
      of adiposity in offspring: A systematic review.

AB  - Childhood obesity and metabolic disorders are of concern and are public health 
      problems globally. Environmental endocrine disruptors, including phthalates, are 
      well known as "obesogens" and "metabolic disruptors". Several studies have 
      investigated the relationships between prenatal phthalate exposure and childhood 
      obesity with inconsistent conclusions. Given the child growth trajectory/pattern 
      as a possible early marker of metabolic disorders, we aimed to assess the effect 
      of prenatal phthalate exposure on offspring growth trajectory. A systematic 
      literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (accessed through PubMed), Web of 
      Science, and CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure) until July 2021. We 
      evaluated the risk of bias for adherence to the prespecified criteria. Fourteen 
      eligible articles were finally included in this systematic review according to 
      the defined PECOS statement. The risk of bias of the included studies was "low" 
      or "probably low", and few were "probably high" and "high". These studies were 
      mostly carried out in the United States (N = 6); others were conducted in China 
      (N = 2), Mexico (N = 2), France (N = 1), Spain (N = 1), Greece (N = 1), and 
      Australia (N = 1) and published from 2015 to 2021. The combined subjects of the 
      14 studies were 10,396 mother-child pairs. Except for 3 studies not reporting the 
      sex ratio, at least 4001 boys and 3366 girls were included. For the association 
      of prenatal phthalate exposure with an absolute adiposity marker (at a specific 
      visit timepoint), only a few studies were using the same obesity marker as the 
      outcome endpoint and using the same statistical method to explore their 
      associations. However, MEP appeared to be positively associated with several 
      obesity markers, such as the absolute BMI z score, weight-for-age z score, waist 
      circumference, and overweight status. For the association of prenatal phthalate 
      exposure with a repeated measurement of the adiposity marker over the age range, 
      neither associations of adiposity markers with a specific phthalate metabolite 
      nor relationships of a specific adiposity marker with prenatal phthalate exposure 
      were of a consistent result. All four articles reported that phthalate metabolite 
      exposure during pregnancy was associated with children's growth trajectory. Three 
      suggested a sex-specific association between prenatal phthalate exposure and 
      obesity trajectory. In conclusion, the current articles did not show any 
      relationship between prenatal phthalate exposure and children's age-specific 
      outcomes, except for positive associations of prenatal MEP exposure with absolute 
      adiposity markers. However, epidemiological data supported a weak relationship 
      between prenatal phthalate exposure and children's obesity trajectory in a 
      sex-specific manner.

TI  - Telehealth Secure Solution to Provide Childhood Obesity Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s22031213 [doi]
LID - 1213
AB  - Childhood obesity causes not only medical and psychosocial problems, it also 
      reduces the life expectancy of the adults that they will become. On a large 
      scale, obese adults adversely affect labor markets and the gross domestic product 
      of countries. Monitoring the growth charts of children helps to maintain their 
      body weight within healthy parameters according to the World Health Organization. 
      Modern technologies allow the use of telehealth to carry out weight control 
      programs and monitoring to verify children's compliance with the daily 
      recommendations for risk factors that can be promoters of obesity, such as 
      insufficient physical activity and insufficient sleep hours. In this work, we 
      propose a secure remote monitoring and supervision scheme of physical activity 
      and sleep hours for the children based on telehealth, multi-user networks, 
      chaotic encryption, and spread spectrum, which, to our knowledge, is the first 
      attempt to consider this service for safe pediatric telemedicine. In experimental 
      results, we adapted a recent encryption algorithm in the literature for the 
      proposed monitoring scheme using the assessment of childhood obesity as an 
      application case in a multi-user network to securely send and receive fictitious 
      parameters on childhood obesity of five users through the Internet by using just 
      one communication channel. The results show that all the monitored parameters can 
      be transmitted securely, achieving high sensitivity against secret key, enough 
      secret key space, high resistance against noise interference, and 4.99 Mb/sec in 
      computational simulations. The proposed scheme can be used to monitor childhood 
      obesity in secure telehealth application.

LID - 10.1089/chi.2021.0048 [doi]
AB  - Background: This study is a longitudinal analysis of how the transition of a 
      mother, father, or any other family member to obesity affects the likelihood of 
      children 5-12 years of age becoming adolescents with overweight or obesity during 
      the 7-10-year period between 2002 and the period from 2009 to 2012 in Mexico. 
      Methods: The study used two rounds of the Mexican Family Life Survey, a 
      multipurpose random national survey that collected information on 8441 
      households, including 38,233 individuals in 2002 and successfully followed up 
      with 3202 children until the period from 2009 to 2012. We used logistic 
      regressions to calculate how family characteristics related to the evolution of 
      body mass indexes among children, controlling for individual, family 
      weight-related characteristics, and the socioeconomic level of the family. 
      Results: The transition of any family member toward obesity is more relevant in 
      determining the transition to obesity among normal-weight children than 
      socioeconomic level of the family and individual characteristics, such as sex, 
      schooling, and occupation. Conclusions: The transition of any family member 
      toward obesity is associated with the transition to obesity among normal-weight 
      children. A family-based approach to obesity prevention has yet to be 
      incorporated into national policies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a third-degree polynomial function (hysteresis) of the 
      effect size of age, obesity, and insulin sensitivity over the carotid 
      intima-media thickness (c-IMT), in the pediatric and adult groups. METHODS: A 
      quasi-experimental study with fixed factor analysis of age (children aged 8-12 
      years, n = 73; adults aged 21-45 years, n = 82) and obesity (yes, n = 76; no, n = 
      79) was conducted to analyze the effect on the c-IMT and Matsuda insulin 
      sensitivity index values. This quasi-experimental design was analyzed with robust 
      regression modeling. RESULTS: The additive effect of obesity, independent of age, 
      was evident in the case of the c-IMT values. There was no interaction effect, but 
      a significant difference between participants with normal weight and those with 
      obesity was found (P < .0001). The difference between adults and children was 
      also significant, but the effect size was smaller. A model was created based on 
      age, Tanner stage, and obesity using the c-IMT and Matsuda insulin sensitivity 
      index values. A linear function fit as R(2), and the cubic function estimated 
      parameters like a polynomial model. CONCLUSION: This practical study design 
      showed that children with obesity displayed the same levels of carotid 
      intima-media abnormalities as adults with obesity. The polynomial shape of the 
      model suggests potentially poor outcomes that resemble the hysteresis process and 
      may predict chronic cardiometabolic events during early adulthood.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of Leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) on 
      cardiometabolic risk by nutritional status in Mexican children and adolescents. 
      METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted with 1,309 participants aged 
      between 5 and 17 years. Nutritional status was classified according to the BMI 
      Z-score by age and gender. A previously validated questionnaire was used to 
      evaluate LTPA; a cardiometabolic risk score was calculated. Multiple linear 
      regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of LTPA on cardiometabolic 
      risk. RESULTS: After adjusting for risk factors, mild LTPA were positively 
      associated with cardiometabolic risk score (βMildvsIntenseLTPA: 0.68; 95% CI: 
      0.18 to 1.18; pfortrend = 0.007). This association became stronger when estimated 
      for overweight (β MildvsIntenseLTPA: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.24 to 2.24; pfortrend = 
      0.015) and obese participants (β MildvsIntenseLTPA: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.07 to 1.97; 
      pfortrend= 0.045). CONCLUSION: Mild LTPA was positively associated with 
      cardiometabolic risk in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Given the 
      emerging childhood obesity epidemic in Mexico, these results may be useful in the 
      design of strategies and programs to increase physical activity levels in order 
      to achieve better health.

TI  - [Metabolic profile and concentration of ghrelin and obestatin in children and 
      adolescents with obesity].
PG  - 268-274
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been pointed out that ghrelin and obestatin could have an 
      impact on the genesis of obesity, since they estimulate and inhibit apetite and, 
      therefore, food consumption. OBJECTIVE: To compare the metabolic profile, lipid 
      profile and the concentrations of ghrelin and obestatin in children with normal 
      weight or obesity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional design with 97 normal 
      weight or obese children, 6 to 18 years of age, who did not present systemic 
      diseases. The serum concentrations of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, 
      triglycerides, high (HDL), low (LDL) and very low density (VLDL) lipoproteins, 
      aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), ghrelin and 
      obestatin were determined. Descriptive statistics were performed. Student's t 
      test was used to compare groups, and correlation coefficients of ghrelin and 
      obestatin values with biochemical and anthropometric variables. A p value of ≤ 
      0.05 was significant. RESULTS: 55 children with normal weight and 42 with obesity 
      were included; mean age was 10.7 years. Triglycerides, LDL, VLDL, ALT and insulin 
      were higher, and HDL lower in obese children (p < 0.05). Ghrelin values were 
      higher in normal weight children (p < 0.05), and there was no difference in 
      obestatin values. CONCLUSIONS: The lower concentration of ghrelin in obese 
      children may indicate a negative feedback to regulate energy consumption. 
      Children and adolescents with obesity show metabolic and lipid profile 
      alterations that place them at risk of early development of cardiovascular risk 
      factors.

LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2014.236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The increase in overweight and obese children and 
      adolescents may be linked to increased rates of dyslipidaemia. The aim was to 
      assess the prevalence of dyslipidaemia and associated risk factors among the 
      Balearic Islands' adolescent population. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A random sample 
      (n=362, 143 boys and 219 girls, aged 12-17 years) was interviewed, 
      anthropometrically measured and fasting blood samples taken. According to the 
      2011 Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk 
      Reduction in Children and Adolescents, dyslipidaemia was defined as the presence 
      of one or more of the following levels (mg/dl): total cholesterol (TChol)⩾200, 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol)⩾130, non-high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (non-HDL-chol)⩾145, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
      (HDL-chol)<40 and tryglicerides (TG)⩾130. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of 
      borderline-high+high TChol, LDL-chol, non-HDL-chol and TG was 24.3, 10.4, 13.3 
      and 14.9%, respectively. The TChol prevalence was higher among girls (27.8%) than 
      the boys (19.1%). The overall prevalence of borderline-low+low HDL-chol was 12.2% 
      (boys 20.7%; girls 6.3%). The overall prevalence of dyslipidaemia was 13.7% (boys 
      14.9%; girls 12.9%). Low HDL-chol levels were the most prevalent dyslipidaemia in 
      boys (6.4%) and high TChol in girls (9.1%). Overweight/obese subjects were more 
      likely to have at least one abnormal lipid concentration (odds ratio (OR): 2.10; 
      95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-4.15) and subjects with abdominal obesity were 
      more likely to have at least one abnormal lipid level (OR: 3.17; 95% CI: 
      1.04-9.66). CONCLUSIONS: One in ten Balearic Islands' adolescents has at least 
      one abnormal lipid concentration. Body mass index status and waist-to-height 
      ratio were associated with the prevalence of at least one abnormal lipid level.

TI  - Sex differences in fetal kidney reprogramming: the case in the renin-angiotensin 
      system.
LID - 10.1007/s00467-023-06112-8 [doi]
AB  - During the early stages of the development of the living multiorgan systems, 
      genome modifications other than sequence variation occur that guide cell 
      differentiation and organogenesis. These modifications are known to operate as a 
      fetal programming code during this period, and recent research indicates that 
      there are some tissue-specific codes in organogenesis whose effects may persist 
      after birth until adulthood. Consequently, the events that disrupt the 
      pre-established epigenetic pattern could induce shifts in organ physiology, with 
      implications on health from birth or later in adult life. Chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) is one of the main causes of mortality worldwide; its etiology is 
      multifactorial, but diabetes, obesity, and hypertension are the main causes of 
      CKD in adults, although there are other risk factors that are mainly associated 
      with an individual's lifestyle. Recent studies suggest that fetal reprogramming 
      in the developing kidney could be implicated in the susceptibility to kidney 
      disease in both childhood and adulthood. Some epigenetic modifications, such as 
      genome methylation status, dysregulation of miRNA, and histone coding alterations 
      in genes related to the regulation of the renin-angiotensin axis, a common 
      denominator in CKD, may have originated during fetal development. This review 
      focuses on epigenetic changes during nephrogenesis and their repercussions on 
      kidney health and disease. In addition, the focus is on the influence of 
      environmental factors during pregnancy, such as maternal metabolic diseases and 
      dietary and metabolic conditions, as well as some sex differences in fetal kidney 
      reprogramming during which dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system is 
      involved.

AB  - Objectives: to analyze the changes of Ow+Ob in a cohort with four years of 
      evolution of students from Mexico elementary schools and to evaluate its 
      association with socio-demographic factors. Methods: information comes from a 
      nutritional surveillance system of 52,545 elementary schools, with weight and 
      height measurements from 2,008,474 children from six to eleven years old. A 
      follow-on panel longitudinal analysis was performed from 2015 to 2019 in a 
      dynamic cohort with three measurements. Ow+Ob prevalences were obtained; through 
      a logistic regression with random effects, odds ratios (OR) were calculated, 
      adjusting by sociodemographic characteristics (p < 0.05). Results: between 2015 
      and 2019, positive OR were observed for Ow+Ob development in 2017-2018 (OR = 
      1.02) and 2018-2019 (OR = 1.06). Students from the northern and southern regions 
      of the country showed a greater probability of suffering Ow+Ob (OR = 1.58 and 
      1.64) when compared with the center. Attending to community or indigenous schools 
      was a protective factor (OR = 0.54) whereas attending to a private school 
      increased the risk (OR = 1.75). Adjusted Ow+Ob prevalences showed an accelerated 
      increasing trend in males through all the periods. Conclusions: in Mexico, 
      obesity in school children is a growing problem related to sociodemographic 
      factors, therefore, urgent actions are needed for its restraining.

TI  - Plant-Based and Plant-Rich Diet Patterns during Gestation: Beneficial Effects and 
      Possible Shortcomings.
PG  - 581-91
LID - 10.3945/an.115.009126 [doi]
AB  - Environmental and lifestyle factors are known to play an important role during 
      gestation, determining newborns' health status and influencing their risk of 
      being subject to certain noncommunicable diseases later in life. In particular, 
      maternal nutritional patterns characterized by a low intake of plant-derived 
      foods could increase the risk of gestation-related issues, such as preeclampsia 
      and pregravid obesity, increase genotoxicant susceptibility, and contribute to 
      the onset of pediatric diseases. In particular, the risk of pediatric wheeze, 
      diabetes, neural tube defects, orofacial clefts, and some pediatric tumors seems 
      to be reduced by maternal intake of adequate amounts of vegetables, fruits, and 
      selected antioxidants. Nevertheless, plant-based diets, like any other diet, if 
      improperly balanced, could be deficient in some specific nutrients that are 
      particularly relevant during gestation, such as n-3 (ω-3) fatty acids, vitamin 
      B-12, iron, zinc, and iodine, possibly affecting the offspring's health state. 
      Here we review the scientific literature in this field, focusing specifically on 
      observational studies in humans, and highlight protective effects elicited by 
      maternal diets enriched in plant-derived foods and possible issues related to 
      maternal plant-based diets.

LID - 10.21149/9753 [doi]
AB  - With increased globalization, Latin America is experiencing transitions from 
      traditional lifestyle and dietary practices to those found in higher income 
      countries. Healthy diets, physical activity and optimal body fat can prevent 
      approximately 15% of cancers in low-income and 20% in high-income countries. We 
      discuss links between diet, obesity, physical activity and cancer, emphasizing 
      strategies targeting children to decrease risk of obesity, control 
      obesity-related risk factors, and reduce sedentary lifestyles, as this will have 
      high impact on adult cancer risk. We focus on individual behaviors, economic, 
      cultural and societal changes that may guide future interventions in the 
      Americas.

TI  - Obesogenic Lifestyle and Its Influence on Adiposity in Children and Adolescents, 
      Evidence from Mexico.
LID - 10.3390/nu12030819 [doi]
LID - 819
AB  - Overweight (OW) and obesity (OB) during childhood/adolescence are major public 
      health problems in Mexico. Several obesogenic lifestyle (OL) risk factors have 
      been identified, but the burden and consequences of them in Mexican 
      children/adolescents remain unclear. The objective of this study was to estimate 
      the prevalence of OL components and describe their relationships with adiposity, 
      and OW/OB. A population-based cross-sectional study of Mexican 
      children/adolescents with nutritional assessment, data collection on daily habits 
      and adiposity as fat-mass index (FMI) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was 
      performed. Individual OL-components: "inactivity," "excessive screen time," 
      "insufficient sleep," "unhealthy-diet", were defined according to non-adherence 
      to previously published healthy recommendations. Results: 1449 subjects were 
      assessed between March 2015 to April 2018. Sixteen percent of subjects had all 
      four OL-components, 40% had three, 35% had two, 9% had one, and 0.5% had none. A 
      cumulative OL score showed a significant dose-response effect with FMI. The 
      combination of inactivity, excessive screen time, and insufficient sleep showed 
      the highest risk association to OW/OB and higher values of FMI. Conclusions: The 
      prevalence of OL-components was extremely high and associated with increased 
      adiposity and OW/OB. Several interventions are needed to revert this major public 
      health threat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Common variants rs6232 and rs6235 in the PCSK1 gene have been 
      associated with obesity in European populations. We aimed to evaluate the 
      contribution of these variants to obesity and related traits in Mexican children 
      and adults. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Rs6232 and rs6235 were genotyped in 
      2382 individuals, 1206 children and 1176 adults. Minor allele frequencies were 
      0.78% for rs6232 and 19.99% for rs6235. Rs6232 was significantly associated with 
      childhood obesity and adult class III obesity (OR = 3.01 95%CI 1.64-5.53; P = 4 × 
      10⁻⁴ in the combined analysis). In addition, this SNP was significantly 
      associated with lower fasting glucose levels (P = 0.01) and with increased 
      insulin levels and HOMA-B (P = 0.05 and 0.01, respectively) only in non-obese 
      children. In contrast, rs6235 showed no significant association with obesity or 
      with glucose homeostasis parameters in any group. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Although rs6232 is rare in the Mexican population, it should be considered as an 
      important risk factor for extreme forms of obesity.

TI  - [Obesity in children and its relationship with chronic kidney disease].
PG  - 514-20
AB  - In the last decades, obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have increased 
      worldwide, in parallel. This article focuses on the current issues of obesity on 
      renal damage, with special emphasis on what happens at pediatric ages. While 
      obesity has been linked closely with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, 
      reduced insulin sensitivity is a direct mechanism for renal damage. The 
      pathophysiologic mechanisms on renal damage include glomerular hyperfiltration 
      and hypertrophy, hypercellularity and broadening of the mesangial regions, while 
      the lack of sensitivity to insulin increases the effects of angiotensin II, 
      exacerbates proteinuria and induces the production of inflammatory cytokines. 
      Many epidemiological studies have documented the relationship of increased BMI 
      with the development of ERC, but most of these studies have been conducted in 
      adults. In children, the information is scarce, but is consistent with findings 
      in adults. In contrast, there are studies which show that interventions aimed to 
      improve weight loss and limit renal damage and proteinuria is reduced, the blood 
      pressure and glomerular filtration rate. Allthe above make us think on the need 
      to improve efforts to reduce the prevalence of obesity from the early stages of 
      life, which could reduce the number of patients with CKD in the future.

TI  - Serum Lipid Profile, Prevalence of Dyslipidaemia, and Associated Risk Factors 
      Among Northern Mexican Adolescents.
PG  - 544-549
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increase in overweight and obese children and adolescents may be 
      linked to increased rates of dyslipidaemia. The aim was to assess the serum lipid 
      profile, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, and associated risk factors among the 
      North Mexican adolescent population. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-three 
      subjects (47.8% girls) ages 11 to 16 years took part in the Nuevo León State 
      Survey of Nutrition and Health 2011-2012. According to the 2011 Expert Panel on 
      Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children 
      and Adolescents, dyslipidaemia was defined as a presence of ≥1 of the following 
      levels (mg/dL): Total cholesterol ≥200, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥130, 
      non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <40, and triglyceride ≥130. RESULTS: The 
      overall frequency of dyslipidaemia was 48.8% with no differences between sexes. 
      Adolescents with high body mass index were more likely to have at least 1 
      abnormal lipid level (overweight: odds ratio [OR]: 2.07; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 1.14-3.77, P < 0.05; obesity: OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.11-4.41, P < 0.05) than 
      those with normal weight. Abdominally subjects with obesity were also more likely 
      to have at least 1 abnormal lipid level (OR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.35-3.91, P < 0.01) 
      than their leaner counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Half of Mexican adolescents living 
      in the State of Nuevo León have at least 1 abnormal lipid concentration. Low 
      HDL-chol level was the most common dyslipidaemia. Body mass index and abdominal 
      obesity were associated with the prevalence of at least 1 abnormal lipid level.

LID - 10.1515/jpem-2019-0077 [doi]
AB  - Background There is no consensus on the definition of metabolically healthy 
      obesity (MHO) and the diagnostic criteria in children. Objectives To estimate the 
      prevalence of MHO and compare clinical and biochemical characteristics between 
      MHO and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO), and to evaluate the association 
      between MUO and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, anthropometrics and family 
      background using different definitions in children. Methods This was a 
      cross-sectional study. Participants included 224 obese children between the years 
      2007 and 2017. MHO was defined by three different criteria: (i) absence of 
      metabolic syndrome (MHO-MS), (ii) no insulin resistance (IR) by homeostatic model 
      assessment (HOMA) <3.16 cut-off (MHO-IR3.16) and (iii) absence of IR at <95th 
      percentile for Mexican children (MHO-95th). Results The prevalence of MHO-MS, 
      MHO-IR3.16 and MHO-IR95th was 12.9%, 56.3% and 41.5%, respectively. The 
      prevalence of simultaneous MHO-MS plus MHO-IR95th was 5.36%. Children with MHO-MS 
      vs. MUO-MS showed lower height, weight and body mass index (BMI) percentiles; 
      MHO-IR3.16 vs. MUO-IR3.16 showed lower age, acanthosis, Tanner, waist 
      circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), 
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and glucose; and MHO-IR95th vs. MUO-IR95th showed 
      lower acanthosis, WC, DBP, glucose and high high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
      (HDL-C). MUO-MS was associated with WC > 90th, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 
      first-degree relatives and obesity in siblings. MUO-IR3.16 was associated with 
      pubertal stages, WC > 90th, WHtR > 0.55 and fasting hyperglycemia. MUO-IR95th was 
      associated with WHtR > 0.55 and HDL < 10th. MHO-MS and MHO-IR3.16 or MHO-IR95th 
      did not have agreement. Conclusions The prevalence of MHO varied depending on the 
      definition, although the real MHO with no MS or IR is very low. Low DBP and high 
      HDL-C in MHO were present in any definition. Association of MUO with 
      anthropometric, biochemical and family background differs across definitions.

      school-aged children.
PG  - 622S-628S
LID - 10.3945/an.112.001974 [doi]
AB  - Diet and physical activity (PA) are essential components of nutritional status. 
      Adequate nutrition and an active lifestyle are key factors during childhood, 
      because food habits track into adulthood. Children spend more time in school than 
      in any other environment away from home. Studying the diet factors and patterns 
      of PA that affect obesity risk in children during school hours and the complete 
      school day can help identify opportunities to lower this risk. We directly 
      measured the time children spent performing moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) at 
      school, compared the amount and intensity of PA during school hours with 
      after-school hours, and tried to determine if diet behaviors and PA or inactivity 
      were associated with excess weight and body fat. This cross-sectional study 
      included 143 normal-weight (NLW) and 48 obese children aged 8-10 y. Diet data 
      were obtained from two 24-h recalls. Body composition was measured by 
      bioimpedance. Screen time and sports participation data were self-reported. NLW 
      children drank/ate more dairy servings than the obese children, who consumed more 
      fruit-flavored water than the NLW group. Consumption of soft drinks, sugar-added 
      juices, and fresh juices was low in both groups. Children were less active during 
      school hours than after school. MVPA was lower during school hours in the obese 
      group than in the NLW group. Schools, parents, and authorities should be more 
      involved in promoting strategies to improve the dietary habits and PA levels of 
      school-aged children, because this group is not achieving the recommended level 
      of daily MVPA.

TI  - Food Insecurity Was Associated with Lower Fruits and Vegetables Consumption but 
      Not with Overweight and Obesity in Children from Mexican Fishing Communities.

AB  - Food insecurity has been associated with decreased household food supplies, which 
      could affect children's fruit and vegetables intakes and increases their risk of 
      being overweight or obese. The aim of this study was to determine if food 
      insecurity was associated with lower fruit and vegetables consumption and 
      overweight and obesity in children from Mexican fishing communities. A 
      cross-sectional study was 4conducted with 100 elementary-school children aged 
      6-12 years. A survey that evaluated socioeconomic conditions, food insecurity, 
      and fruits and vegetables consumption was applied. Weight and height were 
      measured. The association between key variables and food insecurity was assessed 
      using linear regression. Sixty-four percent of households experienced food 
      insecurity. Food-insecure children reported lower consumption of fruits and 
      fruits plus vegetables than did their peers with food security (P trend = 0.040 
      and 0.038, respectively). Food insecurity was also associated with lower chance 
      to meet the recommendation of fruit and vegetable consumption (P trend in logit < 
      0.001), but was negatively associated with the prevalence of overweight and 
      obesity (P trend in logit < 0.001). Food-insecure children had lower fruits and 
      vegetables consumption but were no more likely to be overweight or obese than 
      their food-secure counterparts.

TI  - Overview of systematic reviews of health interventions that aim to prevent and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood overweight and obesity is a global public health issue. 
      Although there is evidence of a reduced prevalence in some countries, there is 
      still much controversy about the efficacy of health interventions that aim to 
      prevent and treat obesity in this specific population. The objective of the 
      present study is to develop an overview of systematic reviews (OSRs) that 
      assesses the effects of school-based, family, and multi-component health 
      interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity, change in physical 
      activity, dietary, and/or hydration behaviors, and change in metabolic risk 
      factors in school-aged children. METHODS: This protocol was developed using the 
      methodology proposed by Cochrane. It outlines a comprehensive search in 12 
      electronic databases to identify systematic reviews of health interventions, 
      including studies that evaluate and how to prevent and/or treat overweight and/or 
      obesity in children aged 6 to 12 years. The risk of bias of the included 
      Systematic Reviews will be assessed with the ROBIS tool. DISCUSSION: Since the 
      OSRs methodology's purpose is only to harmonize evidence from open access 
      publications, ethical consent is not necessary for the present protocol. In terms 
      of diffusion, a paper will be submitted for publication in a scientific journal 
      to describe the main results obtained through the OSRs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The 
      present overview of the systematic review protocol has been registered in 
      PROSPERO (ID number 218296).

PG  - s52-66
AB  - The epidemic of childhood obesity, the risk of developing left ventricular 
      hypertrophy, and evidence of the early development of atherosclerosis in children 
      would make the detection of and intervention in childhood hypertension important 
      to reduce long-term health risks; however, supporting data are lacking. Secondary 
      hypertension is more common in preadolescent children, with most cases caused by 
      renal disease. Primary or essential hypertension is more common in adolescents 
      and has multiple risk factors, including obesity and a family history of 
      hypertension. Evaluation involves a through history and physical examination, 
      laboratory tests, and specialized studies. Management is multifaceted. 
      Nonpharmacologic treatments include weight reduction, exercise, and dietary 
      modifications. Although the evidence of first line therapy for hypertension is 
      still controversial, the recommendations for pharmacologic treatment are based on 
      symptomatic hypertension, evidence of end-organ damage, stage 2 of hypertension, 
      or stage 1 of hypertension unresponsive to lifestyle modifications, and 
      hypertension with diabetes mellitus where is the search for microalbuminuria 
      justified.

TI  - [Prevalence of metabolic syndrome and associated factors in children and 
      adolescents with obesity].
PG  - 568-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children in Mexico are 
      high, as well as the complications associated with their presence. The objective 
      of this work was to estimate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in obese 
      children and adolescents attending a Hospital Clinic and identify the associated 
      factors. METHODS: Cross sectional design with 120 children and adolescents; of 
      either sex, with exogenous obesity and BMI > 2.0 standard deviations. Personal 
      and family history was collected, blood pressure was measured and determination 
      of serum glucose, insulin, lipoprotein HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were 
      performed. The presence of metabolic syndrome with the ATPIII, WHO and 
      International Diabetes Federation criteria was identified. The association of 
      metabolic syndrome with different variables was identified with chi square test 
      and calculation of odds ratio. RESULTS: Mean age was 10.6 ± 2.7 years. The 
      prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 37.5% to 54.5% depending on the criteria 
      used. The presence of metabolic syndrome was associated with a history of large 
      birth weight (OR= 2.21 [1.01-4.82]), and insulin resistance (OR= 6.53 
      [2.40-18.2]). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high in this 
      group of children and adolescents with obesity. The history of large birth weight 
      and the presence of insulin resistance should alert us to the presence of the 
      disease.

AB  - The development of metabolic diseases is linked to the gut microbiota. A 
      cross-sectional study involving 45 children (6 to 12 years old) was conducted to 
      investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and childhood obesity. 
      Anthropometric and metabolic measurements, food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs), 
      and feces samples were obtained. Using the body mass index (BMI) z-score, we 
      categorized each participant as normal weight (NW), or overweight and obese 
      (OWOB). We determined 2 dietary profiles: one with complex carbohydrates and 
      proteins (pattern 1), and the other with saturated fat and simple carbohydrates 
      (pattern 2). The microbial taxonomic diversity and metabolic capacity were 
      determined using shotgun metagenomics. We found differences between both BMI 
      groups diversity. Taxa contributing to this difference, included Eubacterium sp., 
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Dialister, Monoglobus pectinilyticus, 
      Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Intestinibacter bartlettii, Bacteroides 
      intestinalis, Bacteroides uniformis, and Methanobrevibacter smithii. Metabolic 
      capacity differences found between NW and OWOB, included the amino acid 
      biosynthesis pathway, the cofactor, carrier, and vitamin biosynthesis pathway, 
      the nucleoside and nucleotide biosynthesis and degradation pathways, the 
      carbohydrate-sugar degradation pathway, and the amine and polyamine biosynthesis 
      pathway. We found significant associations between taxa such as Ruminococcus, 
      Mitsuokella multacida, Klebsiella variicola, and Citrobacter spp., metabolic 
      pathways with the anthropometric, metabolic, and dietary data. We also found the 
      microbiome's lipooligosaccharide (LOS) category as differentially abundant 
      between BMI groups. Metabolic variations emerge during childhood as a result of 
      complex nutritional and microbial interactions, which should be explained in 
      order to prevent metabolic illnesses in adolescence and maturity. IMPORTANCE The 
      alteration of gut microbiome composition has been commonly observed in diseases 
      involving inflammation, such as obesity and metabolic impairment. Inflammatory 
      host response in the gut can be a consequence of dietary driven dysbiosis. This 
      response is conducive to blooms of particular bacterial species, adequate to 
      survive in an inflammatory environment by means of genetical capability of 
      utilizing alternative nutrients. Understanding the genomic and metabolic 
      contribution of microbiota to inflammation, including virulence factor prevalence 
      and functional potential, will contribute to identifying modifiable early life 
      exposures and preventive strategies associated with obesity risk in childhood.

TI  - Altered perception of the nutritional status of preschoolers by their parents: A 
      risk factor for overweight and obesity.
PG  - 237-142
LID - 10.5546/aap.2016.eng.237 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many parents have a misperception of their children's body size; in 
      general, they underestimate overweight and obesity. OBJECTIVE: To identify the 
      difference between parents' perception of their children's nutritional status and 
      measured body mass index. POPULATION AND METHODS: To identify the difference 
      between parents' perception of their children's nutritional status and measured 
      body mass index. RESULTS: A total of 605 children and their parents were 
      assessed. Seventy-four (12.2%) were overweight and 87 were obese (14.3%). There 
      were 161 overweight or obese children, but 98.8% (159) of parents underestimated 
      their children's nutritional status. Parents' underperception of their children's 
      body size accounted for an OR= 2.1 ± 0.5, p= 0.002 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      1.32-3.32) for obesity and an OR = 4.42 ± 1.2, p < 0.001 (95% CI: 2.631-7.439) 
      for overweight. CONCLUSIONS: Among parents of overweight and obese children, 
      98.8% (159) underestimated their children's weight status. Such underestimation 
      by parents may be a significant risk factor for the development and/or 
      persistence of overweight and obesity in their children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the obesity prevalence among school-age children in Mexico 
      and define possible risk-associated factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 
      National Health and Nutrition Survey (Ensanut 2018-19) was used. Information from 
      6 268 school-age children and 5 670 teenagers was obtained. Logistic regression 
      models were esti-mated in order to study the relationship between overweight and 
      obesity (OW+O) and sociodemographic variables, OW+O condition in their parents, 
      health, dietary and healthy behaviors variables. RESULTS: . OW+O in school-age 
      children and teenagers is associated with the presence of OW+O in their mothers 
      (p<0.001), more time spent in front of a screen and belonging to a middle wealth 
      conditions index; a negative association was found for dietary fiber consumption. 
      In teenagers with obesity, the odds for depression showed an increase. 
      CONCLUSIONS: It is important to identify the predisposing and risk factors and 
      the causes behind obesity in children in order to design integral prevention 
      strategies.

TI  - Population attributable fractions for risk factors for dementia in low-income and 
      middle-income countries: an analysis using cross-sectional survey data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nine potentially modifiable risk factors (less childhood education, 
      midlife hearing loss, hypertension, and obesity, and later-life smoking, 
      depression, physical inactivity, social isolation, and diabetes) account for 35% 
      of worldwide dementia, but most data to calculate these risk factors come from 
      high-income countries only. We aimed to calculate population attributable 
      fractions (PAFs) for dementia in selected low-income and middle-income countries 
      (LMICs) to identify potential dementia prevention targets in these countries. 
      METHODS: The study was an analysis of cross-sectional data obtained from the 
      10/66 Dementia Research surveys of representative populations in India, China, 
      and six Latin America countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Puerto 
      Rico, and Venezuela), which used identical risk factor ascertainment methods in 
      each country. Between 2004 and 2006 (and between 2007 and 2010 for Puerto Rico), 
      all residents aged 65 years and older in predefined catchment areas were invited 
      to participate in the survey. We used risk factor prevalence estimates from this 
      10/66 survey data, and relative risk estimates from previous meta-analyses, to 
      calculate PAFs for each risk factor. To account for individuals having 
      overlapping risk factors, we adjusted PAF for communality between risk factors, 
      and used these values to calculate overall weighted PAFs for India, China, and 
      the Latin American sample. FINDINGS: The overall weighted PAF for potentially 
      modifiable risk factors for dementia was 39·5% (95% CI 37·5-41·6) in China 
      (n=2162 participants), 41·2% (39·1-43·4) in India (n=2004), and 55·8% (54·9-56·7) 
      in our Latin American sample (n=12 865). Five dementia risk factors were more 
      prevalent in these LMICs than worldwide estimates, leading to higher PAFs for 
      dementia: less childhood education (weighted PAF of 10·8% in China, 13·6% in 
      India, and 10·9% in Latin America vs 7·5% worldwide), smoking (14·7%, 6·4%, and 
      5·7%, respectively, vs 5·5% worldwide), hypertension (6·4%, 4·0%, and 9·3%, vs 
      2·0%), obesity (5·6%, 2·9%, and 7·9%, vs 0·8%), and diabetes (1·6%, 1·7%, and 
      3·2%, vs 1·2%). INTERPRETATION: The dementia prevention potential in India, 
      China, and this sample of Latin American countries is large, and greater than in 
      high-income countries. Less education in early life, hypertension, hearing loss, 
      obesity, and physical inactivity have particularly high PAFs and could be initial 
      targets for dementia prevention strategies. FUNDING: No funding.

AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Mexico is 14.4%. This disease is 
      characterized by a state of hyperglycemia and chronic inflammation secondary to 
      inadequate insulin secretion and its resistance. Among its risk factors for 
      metabolic diseases development, the interaction between obesity, sedentary 
      lifestyle, hypercaloric diets and genetic variants play an important role. For 
      decades, different basic and applied research groups have worked in an 
      interdisciplinary way to provide scientific evidence that has helped to 
      understand the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of T2D in Mexicans. 
      However, today the urgency of the advance and better proposals for prevention and 
      management of patients with T2D makes it necessary to use translational medicine, 
      which integrates scientific knowledge with the use of innovative technologies to 
      provide comprehensive health care. In this sense, the present document concisely 
      describes, with a translational approach, the implications of the interaction of 
      environmental and genetic risk factors in the development of childhood obesity 
      and T2D in Mexico.

TI  - Maternal BMI and country of birth as indicators of childhood obesity in children 
      of Mexican origin.
PG  - 2512-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 
      maternal and childhood BMI at baseline in a group of 5- to 18-year-old children 
      and their mothers, all of whom were of Mexican origin, low socioeconomic status, 
      and enrolled in a cohort study in Houston, TX. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: 
      Using data from 438 mother-child dyads residing in the same household, we 
      completed logistic regression analyses to determine maternal factors associated 
      with the child being overweight or at-risk-for-overweight, after adjusting for 
      the child's gender, age, and level of physical activity and other maternal 
      confounders. RESULTS: Almost one-half of the boys and girls (47% and 44%, 
      respectively) were either overweight or at-risk-for-overweight. Obese mothers 
      were twice as likely to have an overweight and/or at-risk-for-overweight child 
      compared with normal-weight mothers. Women born in the U.S. were twice as likely 
      to have an overweight and/or at-risk-for-overweight child compared with women 
      born in Mexico. In addition, women with less than a high school education were 
      twice as likely to have an overweight child compared with their more educated 
      peers. DISCUSSION: The high prevalence of overweight or at-risk-for-overweight 
      among Mexican-origin children of low socioeconomic status suggests a continued 
      need to develop and implement culturally sensitive preventive interventions for 
      this minority population. Our data also suggest a need to tailor such 
      interventions particularly for children of obese mothers and those born in the 
      U.S.

AB  - Worldwide obesity has reached the proportion of an epidemic. A well-established 
      fact is that nowadays many low-and middle-income countries are facing a "double 
      burden" of disease, dealing with under-nutrition on one side, and on the other 
      experiencing a rapid rise in non-communicable disease risk factors such as 
      obesity and overweight, particularly in urban settings. Behavioral components are 
      strongly influencing obesity spread and development, especially when considering 
      TV and advertising. There is, therefore, the need of multi-cultural and 
      cross-cultural research, in order to gain a full understanding of the association 
      between obesity and different risk factors, in different scenarios, providing the 
      best evidence to decision makers, grounding prevention on evidence-based 
      strategies rather than focusing on single factors without the recognition of 
      their mutual influence.

TI  - [Epigenetics of childhood obesity and diabetes].
PG  - S88-93
AB  - Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) result from sedentary lifestyle, 
      high-carbohydrate diets and genetic predisposition. Epigenetics is a form of 
      genetic regulation in specialized cells that does not involve changes in the 
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence, but it can be inherited to one or more 
      generations through mitosis or meiosis. Children whose mothers develop 
      gestational diabetes are more likely to become obese and diabetic in adult life. 
      DNA methylation is a major mechanism in the regulation of transcription and gene 
      expression of several genes. High levels of glucose and insulin during pregnancy 
      modify the risk of developing T2DM, suggesting that the expression pattern is 
      modified due to cell memory in a specific tissue. If T2DM is linked to adaptation 
      in utero, the obvious primary prevention is to protect the fetal development. 
      Future epidemiological studies need to employ more accurate indicators or markers 
      of development to show the relationship between a specific disease and the 
      exposure to environmental factors. The mechanisms by which malnutrition, and 
      intrauterine growth retardation produce changes in the metabolism of glucose and 
      insuline are worth to explore in order to control obesity and T2DM.

TI  - Acanthosis nigricans as a composite marker of cardiometabolic risk and its 
      complex association with obesity and insulin resistance in Mexican American 
      children.
PG  - e0240467
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0240467 [doi]

AB  - AIM: Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a strong correlate of obesity and is considered 
      a marker of insulin resistance (IR). AN is associated with various other 
      cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs). However, the direct causal relationship of 
      IR with AN in obesity has been debated. Therefore, we aimed to examine the 
      complex causal relationships among the troika of AN, obesity, and IR in Mexican 
      Americans (MAs). METHODS: We used data from 670 non-diabetic MA children, aged 
      6-17 years (49% girls). AN (prevalence 33%) severity scores (range 0-5) were used 
      as a quasi-quantitative trait (AN-q) for analysis. We used the program SOLAR for 
      determining phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations between AN-q and 
      CMRFs (e.g., BMI, HOMA-IR, lipids, blood pressure, hs-C-reactive protein (CRP), 
      and Harvard physical fitness score (PFS)). The genetic and environmental 
      correlations were subsequently used in mediation analysis (AMOS program). Model 
      comparisons were made using goodness-of-fit indexes. RESULTS: Heritability of 
      AN-q was 0.75 (p<0.0001). It was positively/significantly (p<0.05) correlated 
      with traits such as BMI, HOMA-IR, and CRP, and negatively with HDL-C and PFS. Of 
      the models tested, indirect mediation analysis of BMI→HOMA-IR→AN-q yielded lower 
      goodness-of-fit than a partial mediation model where BMI explained the 
      relationship with both HOMA-IR and AN-q simultaneously. Using complex models, BMI 
      was associated with AN-q and IR mediating most of the CMRFs; but no relationship 
      between IR and AN-q. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that obesity explains the 
      association of IR with AN, but no causal relationship between IR and AN in 
      Mexican American children.

TI  - Infant feeding, appetite and satiety regulation, and adiposity during infancy: a 
      study design and protocol of the 'MAS-Lactancia' birth cohort.
PG  - e051400
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051400 [doi]
LID - e051400
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of childhood obesity has risen dramatically in 
      recent years. A proportion of this burden has been attributed to factors that 
      occur during the first 1000 days of life such as genetic predisposition, breast 
      feeding and complementary feeding. Although the mechanisms by which these factors 
      affect weight and adiposity are less well understood, appetite and satiety 
      regulation may be a key to understanding them. This cohort study aims to 
      investigate the role of appetite and satiety regulation as a mediator in the 
      association between infant feeding practices and genetic polymorphisms with 
      children's growth, adiposity and metabolic risk factors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 
      'MAS-Lactancia' (the first word means 'more' and is also an acronym in Spanish 
      for 'Appetite and Satiety Mechanisms', the second word is 'breastfeeding') is an 
      open, ongoing, prospective birth cohort that began the enrolment in 2016 of 
      mother-child pairs affiliated to the Mexican Social Security Institute and that 
      live in the city of Cuernavaca, Mexico. Pregnant women between 16-week and 
      22-week gestation are followed during the second half of their pregnancies, at 
      birth and throughout their infant's first 48 months of life (at 1 month, 3 
      months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months and 48 
      months) at the clinic and at-home visits that include questionnaires, 
      anthropometric measurements and biospecimen collection. The main exposure 
      variables are infant feeding (breast feeding and complementary feeding) and 
      genetic polymorphisms (fat mass and obesity-associated, leptin and adiponectin 
      genes). Outcome variables include infant's growth, adiposity and metabolic risk 
      factors. We will conduct longitudinal models and path analyses to identify the 
      potential mediating role of satiety and appetite indicators (leptin, adiponectin, 
      insulin concentrations, appetite and satiety perception). ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The study protocol, data collection instruments, consent forms and 
      procedures were approved by the institutional review boards of the National 
      Institute of Public Health and the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mexico. 
      Findings will be disseminated through conferences, peer-reviewed publications and 
      meetings with stakeholders.

TI  - Fine-mapping of 98 obesity loci in Mexican children.
PG  - 23-32
LID - 10.1038/s41366-018-0056-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Mexico has one of the highest prevalence of childhood 
      obesity in the world. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for obesity have 
      identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in populations of 
      European, East Asian, and African descent. The contribution of these loci to 
      obesity in Mexican children is unclear. We assessed the transferability of 98 
      obesity loci in Mexican children and fine-mapped the association signals. 
      SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study included 405 and 390 Mexican children with normal 
      weight and obesity. Participants were genotyped with a genome-wide dense SNP 
      array designed for Latino populations, allowing for the analysis of GWAS index 
      SNPs as well as fine-mapping SNPs, totaling 750 SNPs covering 98 loci. Two 
      genetic risk scores (GRS) were constructed: a "discovery GRS" and a 
      "best-associated GRS", representing the number of effect alleles at the GWAS 
      index SNPs and at the best-associated SNPs after fine-mapping for each subject. 
      RESULTS: Seventeen obesity loci were significantly associated with obesity, and 
      five had fine-mapping SNPs significantly better associated with obesity than 
      their corresponding GWAS index SNPs in Mexican children. Six obesity-associated 
      SNPs significantly departed from additive to dominant (N = 5) or recessive 
      (N = 1) models, and a significant interaction was found between rs274609 (TNNI3K) 
      and rs1010553 (ITIH4) on childhood obesity risk. The best-associated GRS was 
      significantly more associated with childhood obesity (OR = 1.21 per additional 
      risk allele [95%CI:1.17-1.25], P = 4.8 × 10(-25)) than the discovery GRS 
      (OR = 1.05 per additional risk allele [95%CI:1.02-1.08], P = 8.0 × 10(-4)), and 
      was also associated with waist-to-hip ratio, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and 
      triglyceride levels, the association being mediated by obesity. An overall 
      depletion of obesity risk alleles was observed in Mexican children with normal 
      weight when compared to GWAS discovery populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      indicates a partial transferability of GWAS obesity loci in Mexican children, and 
      supports the pertinence of post-GWAS fine-mapping experiments in the admixed 
      Mexican population.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the prevalence rates for overweight and obesity 
      among Mexican schoolchildren, identifying factors associated with the outcomes. A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample consisting of 700 schoolchildren. 
      Prevalence rates were calculated according to age and gender, and odds ratios 
      were estimated by point and intervals, using multivariate logistic regression. 
      Overweight and obesity prevalence were 28.1% and 13.7%, respectively. Risk 
      factors for overweight were: mother's schooling (in years); eating while studying 
      or watching TV; scores for risk food items > or = 12 points; sedentary activities 
      > or = 1.6 hours/day, and birth weight > or = 2,890 grams. Obesity risk factors 
      were similar to those related to overweight. Higher frequency of sport activities 
      was detected as a protective factor in both outcomes. The associated factors for 
      overweight and obesity highlighted the focus for health programs to prevent 
      chronic diseases in this population, for which risk factors can already be 
      identified in childhood.

TI  - Association between neck circumference and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in 
      Mexican children and adolescents with obesity.
PG  - 205-213
LID - 10.1515/jpem-2019-0204 [doi]
AB  - Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent 
      chronic hepatic disorder in the pediatric population and has grown along with the 
      obesity pandemic in which we live today. Adipose tissue storage in the upper body 
      segment has been positively correlated with visceral adiposity and metabolic 
      disease, which suggests that neck circumference could represent an easily 
      accessible and replicable anthropometric measurement to identify patients with a 
      higher risk of developing NAFLD. The main purpose of this study is to determine 
      if there is an association between neck circumference and NAFLD. The secondary 
      objectives are to establish cutoff values based on gender and puberty staging. 
      Methods We included a sample pediatric population of 112 patients diagnosed with 
      obesity aged between 6 and 18 years. We performed anthropometric and metabolic 
      measurements on every patient, and NAFLD diagnosis was determined with hepatic 
      ultrasound. Results The neck circumference was larger in NAFLD pediatric patients 
      compared to those without NAFLD (p = 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the neck 
      circumference was associated with NAFLD as an independent risk factor (odds ratio 
      [OR] = 1.172; 95% CI = 1.008-1.362; p = 0.038). Tanner 2-3 = 35 cm and Tanner 
      4-5 = 38 cm were established as risk cutoff values to develop NAFLD in the male 
      adolescent population. Conclusions There is an association between the neck 
      circumference and NAFLD in pediatric patients with obesity, particularly in the 
      male population.

AB  - Exercise-induced irisin, a recently discovered myokine, has been linked to 
      insulin resistance, obesity, and other diseases in adults; however, information 
      in children is scarce and contradictory. We analyzed the limited evidence of 
      irisin's effects in children and adolescents, and its association with body 
      composition, exercise training, cardiovascular risk factors, and metabolic 
      diseases, as well as the results of dietetic interventions. Both positive and 
      negative correlations between irisin concentrations and body mass index, fat 
      mass, fat-free mass, and other anthropometric parameters were found. Likewise, 
      contradictory evidence was shown associating irisin plasma levels with 
      cardiovascular and metabolic parameters such as glucose, insulin resistance, and 
      cholesterol and other lipid and fatty acid plasma levels in healthy children, as 
      well as in those with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Gender, puberty, and 
      hormonal differences were also examined. Furthermore, important contradictory 
      findings according to the type and duration of exercise and of dietetic 
      interventions in healthy and unhealthy subjects were demonstrated. In addition, 
      correlations between mother⁻infant relations and circulating irisin were also 
      identified. This review discusses the potential role of irisin in health and 
      disease in the pediatric population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to explore the risk factors that 
      contribute to obesity in Mexican American children compared with Mexican American 
      normal weight children. No hypotheses were tested in the study. When risk factors 
      are known, nurses can use evidence to reduce risky behavior. METHOD: A 
      cross-sectional descriptive design was used, comparing two groups of children to 
      discern the risk factors for obesity. The setting is a county in South Texas 
      along the border with Mexico. The sample consisted of 55 Mexican American dyads 
      (mother-child). The following measures, based on the Ecological Model of Growth, 
      were used to collect data: anthropometrics, dietary data of children, home 
      environment, perceived stress of mother, and maternal acculturation. Independent 
      sample t tests, chi-square tests, Fisher exact tests, and a hierarchical logistic 
      regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The findings show 
      children's age and maternal body mass index (BMI) are positively correlated with 
      childhood obesity, as measured by BMI percentile by age/sex. There were 
      significant differences in the host and agent factors of prolonged bottle 
      feeding, amount of outdoor play, and fruit drinks between normal weight and obese 
      children. DISCUSSION: Engagement and involvement of other family members in 
      outdoor activities, nutrition/feeding, and child care may mitigate the negative 
      effects of host and agent factors on child body size.

AB  - Cancer treatments are associated with short and long-effects. Epidemiological 
      reports have revealed clinical features of metabolic syndrome (MS), obesity or 
      overweight in young cancer survivors. The aim of the study was to examine the 
      prevalence of unhealthy weight status and risk factors associated with MS related 
      to chemotherapy. We study 52 pediatric cancer patients and analyze cholesterol, 
      triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin, body mass index, waist circumference 
      (WC), FINDRISC test. All the parameters were analyzed according to the percentile 
      corresponding to sex and age of each child. The data show an important 
      modification in weight, body mass index, and WC as in triglycerides, and 
      cholesterol that could be associated with the development of MS. The variance 
      analysis showed that the WC, triglycerides, and cholesterol are statistically 
      correlated in our population. A follow-up for MS in children cancer survivor 
      should be considered necessary.

LID - 10.1002/ijc.31068 [doi]
AB  - Differences and similarities in cancer patterns between the country of Mexico and 
      the United States' Mexican population, 11% of the entire US population, have not 
      been studied. Mortality data from 2008 to 2012 in Mexico and California were 
      analyzed and compared for causes of cancer death among adult and pediatric 
      populations, using standard techniques and negative binomial regression. A total 
      of 380,227 cancer deaths from Mexico and California were included. Mexican 
      Americans had 49% and 13% higher mortality than their counterparts in Mexico 
      among males and females, respectively. For Mexican Immigrants in the US, overall 
      cancer mortality was similar to Mexico, their country of birth, but 
      all-cancers-combined rates mask wide variation by specific cancer site. The most 
      extreme results were recorded when comparing Mexican Americans to Mexicans in 
      Mexico: with mortality rate ratios ranging from 2.72 (95% CI: 2.44-3.03) for 
      colorectal cancer in males to 0.28 (95% CI: 0.24-0.33) for cervical cancer in 
      females. These findings further reinforce the preeminent role that the 
      environment, in its multiple aspects, has on cancer. Overall, mortality from 
      obesity and tobacco-related cancers was higher among Mexican origin populations 
      in the US compared to Mexico, suggesting a higher risk for these cancers, while 
      mortality from prostate, stomach, and especially cervical and pediatric cancers 
      was markedly higher in Mexico. Among children, brain cancer and neuroblastoma 
      patterns suggest an environmental role in the etiology of these malignancies as 
      well. Partnered research between the US and Mexico for cancer studies is 
      warranted.

      students in Merida, Mexico].
PG  - 94-103
LID - 10.24875/BMHIM.M18000018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some studies have found a negative relationship between obesity and 
      school performance in scholars. However, this topic has not been studied in depth 
      in Mexico. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between 
      overweight and obesity with school performance in secondary school students from 
      Merida. METHODS: Weight and height were measured, and body mass index was 
      calculated in a sample of 566 secondary students in Merida. Nutritional status 
      was classified in normal weight (-2-<+1 standard deviation [SD]), overweight 
      (+1-<2 SD) and obesity (> + 2 SD) according to the World Health Organization 
      criteria. The scores in language, mathematics and sciences were used as 
      indicators of school performance. Good performance was considered when the scores 
      were ≥8 points, and poor performance when scores were <8 points. Logistic 
      regression models were used to analyse the association between the variables. 
      RESULTS: The 44% of the sample met the criteria for overweight and obesity. After 
      adjusting for school grade, type of school, number of absences, and Mayan 
      surnames, we found that girls classified as obese had a significant risk of a 
      poor performance in mathematics (odds ratio [OR]: 3.07; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 1.39-6.80) and language (OR: 2.55; 95% CI: 1.14-5.71) compared with those 
      with healthy weight. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that obesity represents a 
      risk of having a lower school performance in girls but not in boys.

PG  - 358-366

AB  - Background: Differences in gut microbiota composition have been associated with 
      obesity and metabolic alterations in children. The aim of this study was to 
      analyze the abundance of the main bacterial families of the gut among children 
      according to their body composition and metabolic markers. Methods: A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted with 93 school-aged children (8.4 ± 1.6 years 
      old). Anthropometric and body composition variables were measured and a blood 
      sample was collected to determine glucose, insulin, lipid profile, C-reactive 
      protein, leptin, and cytokines [interleukin 6, interleukin 10 (IL-10), tumor 
      necrosis factor α (TNFα)]. DNA was extracted from stool samples and the abundance 
      of bacterial families (Bacteroidaceae-Porphyromonadaceae-Prevotellaceae, 
      Lactobacillaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae-Ruminococcaceae) was 
      determined by qPCR assays. Results: Children with obesity and high waist/height 
      ratio had lower Bacteroidaceae-Porphyromonadaceae-Prevotellaceae and higher 
      abundance of Lactobacillaceae when compared with normal-weight children. TNFα was 
      negatively associated and IL-10 was positively associated with 
      Bacteroidaceae-Porphyromonadaceae-Prevotellaceae. Triglycerides showed a positive 
      relationship with Lachnospiraceae-Ruminococcaceae whereas high-density 
      lipoprotein-cholesterol was negatively associated with Lactobacillaceae. 
      Conclusion: In rural Mexican school-aged children, a low abundance of 
      Bacteroidaceae-Porphyromonadaceae-Prevotellaceae and a high abundance of 
      Lactobacillaceae are associated with obesity and metabolic disturbances.

TI  - [Stunting, overweight and obesity during the nutrition transition in 
      schoolchildren of Arandas, Jalisco, Mexico].
PG  - 6-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutrition transition provokes changes in the nutritional status of 
      individuals subjected to the interaction of various environmental factors; 
      therefore, the aim was to demonstrate that nutrition transition is associated 
      with socioeconomic changes, eating habits and physical activity, potentially 
      involved in stunting, overweight and obesity of schoolchildren. METHODS: 
      Case-control study. 102 participants from the Instituto Alteño para el Desarrollo 
      de Jalisco (cases) and 194 from the elementary school system (controls), aged 5 
      to 12 years, were included. Dependent variables were these indexes weight/age 
      (Z), height/age (Z), BMI (Z). Independent variables were the socioeconomic and 
      demographic characteristics. Student's t test, chi square, odds ratio (OR) and 
      95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. RESULTS: Family income was low 
      (p = 0.031) and unstable job was higher in cases: OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 2.8-6.0. The 
      frequency of stunting was higher in cases (9.9% vs. 5.9%). The combination of 
      overweight/obesity was higher in controls (27.3% vs. 16.8%), OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 
      1.0-3.4. CONCLUSIONS: The nutritional status of children of Arandas, Jalisco, has 
      been modified by an accelerate nutrition transition, provoked by socioeconomic, 
      educational and demographic factors that might have influence on the persistence 
      of stunting and an increasing prevalence of overweight/obesity.

AB  - Millions of Mexico, US and across the world children are overweight and obese. 
      Exposure to fossil-fuel combustion sources increases the risk for obesity and 
      diabetes, while long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone 
      (O3) above US EPA standards is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). Mexico City Metropolitan Area children are chronically exposed to 
      PM2.5 and O3 concentrations above the standards and exhibit systemic, brain and 
      intrathecal inflammation, cognitive deficits, and Alzheimer disease 
      neuropathology. We investigated adipokines, food reward hormones, endothelial 
      dysfunction, vitamin D and apolipoprotein E (APOE) relationships in 80 healthy, 
      normal weight 11.1±3.2 year olds matched by age, gender, BMI and SES, low (n: 26) 
      versus high (n:54) PM2.5 exposures. Mexico City children had higher leptin and 
      endothelin-1 (p<0.01 and p<0.000), and decreases in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP 
      1), ghrelin, and glucagon (<0.02) versus controls. BMI and leptin relationships 
      were significantly different in low versus high PM2.5 exposed children. Mexico 
      City APOE 4 versus 3 children had higher glucose (p=0.009). Serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D<30 ng/mL was documented in 87% of Mexico City children. 
      Leptin is strongly positively associated to PM 2.5 cumulative exposures. Residing 
      in a high PM2.5 and O3 environment is associated with 12h fasting 
      hyperleptinemia, altered appetite-regulating peptides, vitamin D deficiency, and 
      increases in ET-1 in clinically healthy children. These changes could signal the 
      future trajectory of urban children towards the development of insulin 
      resistance, obesity, type II diabetes, premature cardiovascular disease, 
      addiction-like behavior, cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Increased 
      efforts should be made to decrease pediatric PM2.5 exposures, to deliver health 
      interventions prior to the development of obesity and to identify and mitigate 
      environmental factors influencing obesity and Alzheimer disease.

TI  - Identification of metabolic indicators for cardiovascular risk in schoolchildren.
PG  - 89-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: CardioVascular Disease (CVD) is one of the most important causes of 
      death worldwide affecting people at younger ages every year. The purpose of this 
      study was to identify the metabolic indicators for cardiovascular risk factors in 
      primary school students from Mexico and Colombia. METHODS: A clinical, 
      prospective, cross-sectional and comparative study was conducted in Mexico and 
      Colombia to contrast anthropometric measurements, biochemical and dietetic 
      determinations and physical activity. RESULTS: The Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR) and the 
      Waist-to-Height Ratio (WtHR) showed significant differences (p≤0.001) between 
      Mexico and Colombia (0.8 ± 0.1 versus 0.5 ± 0.1) and (0.4 ± 0.06 vs. 0.78 ± 0.04) 
      respectively. The Automatic Linear Modeling showed that the main predictors for 
      cholesterol levels were WtHR, MonoUnsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA) and lipids 
      ingestion. For glucose there were four main predictors: WHR, carbohydrates, MUFA 
      and Saturated Fatty Acids (SFA). For triglycerides the pedictors were Products of 
      Animal Origin (PAO), BMI, waist circumference, lipids and cholesterol ingestion 
      and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). The Weight Estimation tests weighted per gender 
      showed that for glucose levels the main determinants were carbohydrates, MUFA and 
      oils; for cholesterol these were MUFA, PUFA and oils; and for LDL the significant 
      variables were proteins, SFA, PAO and sugars; and last, for triglycerides the 
      main variables were BMI, cholesterol and vegetables. CONCLUSIONS: Mexico has 
      higher values in almost all items of cardiovascular risk in children, but both 
      countries have significant percentages of obesity and the population free of 
      cardiovascular risk is minimal.

TI  - La Vida Buena (The Good Life) evaluation: a quasi experimental intervention of a 
      community health worker-led family-based childhood obesity program for Latino 
      children 5-8 years of age on the US-Mexico border.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to multiple and interacting factors, Latino children are 
      disproportionately at risk for overweight and obesity in the United States. 
      Childhood obesity increases the risk for adverse physical and psychosocial 
      outcomes throughout the lifespan. Intensive behavioral interventions recommended 
      in primary care settings may not conform to current practices, and the most 
      vulnerable populations are often unable to access these services. Community 
      Health Workers (CHWs) offer a promising approach to bridging the gap between 
      vulnerable communities and culturally competent services. La Vida Buena (The Good 
      Life) is an 8-week family-focused intervention for Latino children 5-8 years old 
      and their parents or caregivers who are patients at a Federally-Qualified 
      Community Health Center (FQHC). It is a culturally and linguistically appropriate 
      curriculum, facilitated by CHWs, that targets family behaviors to foster a 
      healthy lifestyle in order to prevent and mitigate childhood overweight and 
      obesity. METHODS: The primary objective is to test the effectiveness of the La 
      Vida Buena (LVB) childhood obesity program among Latino children 5-8 years old 
      and their families as compared with a single educational session. This study uses 
      a parallel two-arm quasi-experimental design. The intervention group receives the 
      8-week La Vida Buena intervention and the comparison group receives a single 
      educational session. The primary outcome is the change in the child's BMI z-score 
      from baseline to 6 months. DISCUSSION: The implementation and evaluation of La 
      Vida Buena may inform research and practice for linking Latino patients in FQHCs 
      to culturally responsive community-based childhood obesity interventions. It will 
      also contribute to the literature about CHWs as facilitators of behavior change 
      for families underserved by health services and preventive programs. La Vida 
      Buena can serve as a culturally and linguistically appropriate early intervention 
      curriculum that will foster a healthy home environment for childhood obesity 
      mitigation and prevention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was retrospectively 
      registered on December 18, 2018. The ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is 
      NCT03781856.

AB  - INTRODUCTIÓN: Obesity is a serious public health problem in Mexico, the National 
      Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT 2012) reported a 34.4% prevalence of 
      overweight, and obesity in children aged 5-11. Recent research has suggested that 
      the gut microbiota may be a risk factor of obesity through its influence on human 
      metabolism. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate association between the intestinal 
      microbiota profile and obesity among children and whether this association is 
      modified depending on the feeding pattern of a sample of schoolchildren from 
      Mexico City. METODOLOGY AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional study on 1042 children aged 
      6-14 years; physical activity questionnaire, personal medical history and 
      heredofamilial of obesity and type 2 diabetes were administered to all the 
      children. Eating patterns was performed by principal component analysis (PCA). 
      The association between intestinal microbiota and overweight / obesity depending 
      on diet was assessed with logistic regression models. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      shows that the interaction between the intestinal microbiota and diet, 
      particularly high in fats and simple carbohydrates increases the chance of 
      developing obesity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of an 18-month school obesity prevention 
      intervention on the health behaviors of 4th and 5th grade students based on 
      ecological principles and formative research conducted in Mexico. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A Randomized Control Trial (RCT), design was used to assign 27 schools 
      to one of three conditions: basic or plus interventions and control. School 
      environment measures, children's eating and physical activity behaviors, and body 
      mass index were assessed four times over a 2-year period in a sample of 830 
      students. RESULTS: In the intervention schools, the availability of healthy foods 
      increased with a concomitant decrease in unhealthy food availability. Food intake 
      showed the same trend. In the intervention schools, children did not engage in 
      more moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in physical education (PE) 
      class or recess but increased steps taken. Obesity prevalence did not change. 
      CONCLUSION: The intervention improved the school food environment and child 
      healthy behaviors.

TI  - The Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey as a Basis for Public Policy 
      Planning: Overweight and Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/nu11081727 [doi]
LID - 1727
AB  - Mexico has one of the highest overweight and obesity rates in the world. Our 
      objective is to describe the tendency of overweight and obesity by sex, health 
      service affiliation, and socioeconomic tertile (T1,2,3), and to give examples of 
      public policies derived from the results of the Mexican National Health and 
      Nutrition Surveys (ENSANUT). Data come from the 2006, 2012, and 2016 ENSANUTs, 
      which are probabilistic surveys that allow us to make inferences at the national 
      level, on urban and rural strata and regions; their coverage includes all the 
      population age groups. We assessed overweight and obesity (OW + O) in all 
      population groups. The prevalence of OW + O in preschool children was lower in T1 
      in all the surveys, and shows an increase by year of survey, according to the 
      health service affiliation. In school-age women, prevalence increased over the 10 
      years of evaluation, in spite of the high prevalence in both genders in T3. 
      Adolescent behavior is similar and, in adults, the prevalence of OW + O shows an 
      increase by year of survey, gender, and affiliation, with the differences not 
      explained by socioeconomic tertile. In conclusion, the ENSANUT series represents 
      a surveillance system that allow us to observe the changes in overweight and 
      obesity prevalence over the time, showing a high prevalence of OW + O in the 
      population, and has contributed to public policy enhancement.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The number of colony-forming unit (CFU)-Hill colonies has 
      been proposed as a biomarker of vascular function and cardiovascular risk in 
      adults but information about its role in children is scarce. This study evaluates 
      the associations between obesity, cardiovascular risk factors and breastfeeding 
      history with the numbers of CFU-Hill colonies in a sample of young people. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected 49 children and teenagers between ages 10 and 17 
      (65.3% boys) from Mexican Health Care system. Physical activity and 
      Anthropometric measures data were registered. CFU-Hill colonies were cultured 
      from mononuclear cells obtained from venous blood. We detected inverse 
      associations between the formation of CFU-Hill colonies and body mass index (BMI; 
      β = -1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.92, -1.13), triglycerides (β = -0.26; 
      95%CI = -0.34, -0.18), total cholesterol (β = -0.13; 95%CI = -0.17, -0.08), Low 
      Density Lipoprotein (LDL) (β = -0.20; 95%CI = -0.31, -0.09) and glucose 
      (β = -0.37; 95%CI = -0.55, -0.18) using multivariate models. Breastfeeding 
      duration showed a 1.46-colony increase for each month of breastfeeding 
      (95%CI = 0.73, 2.18). CONCLUSIONS: CFU-Hill colony-forming capacity in children 
      and teenagers was inversely associated with obesity, dyslipidemia and high blood 
      levels of glucose. In contrast a longer breastfeeding duration was directly 
      associated with an increased number of CFU-Hill colonies. However these results 
      must be confirmed with further studies. Our findings support the importance of 
      promoting breastfeeding and monitoring nutritional and metabolic status at an 
      early age to prevent chronic disease development.

TI  - Overweight with concurrent stunting in very young children from rural Mexico: 
      prevalence and associated factors.
PG  - 623-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document the prevalence of overweight or obesity concurrent with 
      stunting in rural low-income Mexican children and to identify demographic and 
      socio-economic characteristics that could help identify families at risk of 
      having an overweight/obese and stunted young child in this population. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional analysis of the nutritional status of very young children, using 
      primary data from a rural community-based survey conducted in 2003. Overweight, 
      obesity and stunting were documented along with several maternal, household and 
      community characteristics. SETTING: Impoverished areas of rural Mexico. SUBJECTS: 
      Pre-school children (n=7555), aged 24-72 months. RESULTS: The combined prevalence 
      of overweight and obesity was equal to or greater than 20% in all children, as 
      was the prevalence of stunting. The prevalence of concurrent overweight or 
      obesity and stunting was approximately 5% in non-indigenous children, and over 
      10% in indigenous children 24-60 months. A multinomial logistic analysis revealed 
      that the factors associated with coexisting stunting and overweight/obesity were 
      lower socio-economic status (SES), lower maternal age, education, intelligence 
      (vocabulary) and perceived social status, shorter maternal height, and larger 
      household size. Among only stunted children, the risk of also being overweight or 
      obese was associated with younger maternal age (relative risk ratios (RRR): 0.98, 
      P=0.05), lower maternal perceived social status (RRR: 0.95, P<0.01) and maternal 
      obesity (RRR: 2.93, P<0.0001) or overweight (RRR: 1.50, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These analyses highlight that concurrent overweight or obesity and stunting is an 
      important public health issue in low-income areas of rural Mexico beginning in 
      early childhood. Even within this impoverished population, children living in 
      households with low relative SES are the most vulnerable. SPONSORSHIP: Financial 
      support for this research was provided by the National Institutes of Child Health 
      and Human Development, the Fogarty International Center at NIH, the John D and

AB  - Dietary energy density (DED) has been widely considered a risk factor for weight 
      gain. In adolescents, however, the evidence is inconclusive, and in Mexico, the 
      ways in which DED is associated with overweight and obesity are unknown. Our 
      study analysed the association of DED with overweight or obesity (OW-O) in 
      Mexican adolescents included in the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012 
      (ENSANUT 2012). We analysed the data from a 7-day Food Frequency Questionnaire 
      administered to 2,203 Mexican adolescents aged 12-19 years. DED was calculated 
      excluding all beverages. Plausible and implausible reporters were identified 
      based on the relationship between the reported energy intake and the estimated 
      energy requirement. The association of DED with body mass index (BMI)-for-age and 
      OW-O was analysed using multivariate statistical models restricted to plausible 
      reporters. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity was 35.4% in the 
      complete sample and 27.8% in the sample of plausible reporters. Mean DED was 
      177 kcal/100 g, with higher DED in the north of the country. The proportion of 
      plausible reporters was 38.5%. We found a positive association between high DED 
      and the BMI-for-age z-score (β = 0.347; 95% CI [0.101, 0.594]; P = 0.006), 
      controlling for sociodemographic and dietary variables, but no significant 
      association with OW-O. It is necessary to consider the DED in the design and 
      implementation of strategies to reduce energy density in the diets of young 
      Mexicans.

TI  - Old Fashioned vs. Ultra-Processed-Based Current Diets: Possible Implication in 
      the Increased Susceptibility to Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease in Childhood.
LID - 10.3390/foods6110100 [doi]
LID - 100
AB  - Ultra-processed foods are ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat products created to 
      replace traditional homemade meals and dishes due to convenience and 
      accessibility. Because of their low-fiber and high-fat and sugar composition, 
      these foodstuffs could induce a negative impact on health. They are partially 
      responsible for obesity and chronic non-transmissible diseases; additionally, 
      they could impact in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 
      diabetes and celiac disease. The rationale is that the nutritional composition of 
      ultra-processed foodstuffs can induce gut dysbiosis, promoting a pro-inflammatory 
      response and consequently, a "leaky gut". These factors have been associated with 
      increased risk of autoimmunity in genetically predisposed children. In addition, 
      food emulsifiers, commonly used in ultra-processed products could modify the gut 
      microbiota and intestinal permeability, which could increase the risk of 
      autoimmunity. In contrast, unprocessed and minimally processed food-based diets 
      have shown the capacity to promote gut microbiota eubiosis, anti-inflammatory 
      response, and epithelial integrity, through bacterial butyrate production. Thus, 
      to decrease the susceptibility to autoimmunity, genetically predisposed children 
      should avoid ultra-processed food products and encourage the consumption of fresh 
      and minimally processed foods.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describir el papel de la percepción del gusto como factor de riesgo 
      para el desarrollo de obesidad en niños. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ulos científicos 
      publicados en PubMed entre el 1 de enero de 2011 y el 20 de marzo de 2016 para el 
      tema sobrepeso y obesidad en niños de entre 0 y 12 años. Los algoritmos 
      utilizados fueron (Obesity OR Overweight) AND Taste perception, Satiation, 
      Satiety response, Appetite, Appetite regulation, Habituation, Taste receptors 
      [MeSH] y PROP phenotype. En búsquedas subsecuentes se incluyeron artículos 
      previos y posteriores a la fecha de la búsqueda general (hasta mayo 2018). 
      RESULTS: Las preferencias por los sabores inician desde la gestación, por lo que 
      los niños que son expuestos a sabores dulces en etapas tempranas de la infancia 
      aumentan su riesgo de habituación a éstos. Asimismo, las experiencias hedónicas 
      dadas por la ingestión de alimentos y bebidas dulces refuerzan el consumo de 
      estos alimentos, lo que propicia la selección de productos o bebidas de sabor 
      dulce en etapas posteriores. Estas preferencias se han asociado con el desarrollo 
      de obesidad en los niños. Las variantes genéticas relacionadas con la percepción 
      del gusto también pueden contribuir a la selección de cierto tipo de alimentos. 
      Sin embargo, su relación con una mayor ingestión de energía, así como con un 
      mayor peso corporal, ha sido poco explorada y ha mostrado resultados 
      inconsistentes. CONCLUSIONS: Se requiere más evidencia para entender las 
      interacciones ambientales y genéticas de la percepción del gusto, a fin de 
      considerarlo un factor más en las intervenciones de política pública.

AB  - Childhood overweight and obesity are worldwide public health problems and risk 
      factors for chronic diseases. The presence of SNP in several genes has been 
      associated with the presence of obesity. A total of 580 children (8-13 years old) 
      from Queretaro, Mexico, participated in this cross-sectional study, which 
      evaluated the associations of rs9939609 (fat mass obesity-associated (FTO)), 
      rs17782313 (melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R)) and rs6548238 (transmembrane protein 
      18 (TMEM18)) SNP with obesity and metabolic risk factors. Overweight and obesity 
      prevalence was 19·8 and 19·1 %, respectively. FTO, MC4R and TMEM18 risk allele 
      frequency was 17, 9·8 and 89·5 %, respectively. A significant association between 
      FTO homozygous and MC4R heterozygous risk alleles and obesity was found (OR 3·9; 
      95 % CI 1·46, 10·22, and OR 2·1; 95 % CI 1·22, 3·71; respectively). The FTO 
      heterozygous subjects showed higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, 
      compared with the homozygous for the ancestral allele subjects. These results 
      remain significant after considering adiposity as a covariate. The FTO and MC4R 
      genotypes were not significantly associated with total cholesterol, 
      HDL-cholesterol and insulin concentration. No association was found between 
      TMEM18 risk allele and obesity and/or metabolic alterations. Our results show 
      that, in addition to a higher BMI, there is also an association of the risk 
      genotype with blood pressure in the presence of the FTO risk genotype. The 
      possible presence of a risk genotype in obese children must be considered to 
      offer a more comprehensive therapeutic approach in order to delay and/or prevent 
      the development of chronic diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between caries 
      experience and obesity in Mexican schoolchildren aged 8-12 years. STUDY DESIGN: 
      This is a cross-sectional study. METHODS: This study was conducted on 522 
      schoolchildren selected from public schools. The prevalence of caries was 
      evaluated by applying the decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) index and 
      ascertaining the subjects' dental caries experience from the mean DMFT value. 
      Socio-economic data were collected from the parents, with data on the children's 
      characteristics collected from them via a questionnaire. Their weight and height 
      were then measured and used to calculate their body mass index (BMI)-for-age 
      Z-score, which was then adjusted by age and sex. RESULTS: The prevalence of 
      caries was 79.9% (DMFT≥1) in permanent dentition. Of all children, 47.5% of them 
      brushed their teeth two or more times per day, and the prevalence of overweight 
      and obesity was 20.1% and 17.6%, respectively. The logistic regression model 
      showed that children with obesity (a >2 Z-score on the BMI-for-age growth chart) 
      were less likely to have dental caries (odds ratio [OR] = 0.53 [95% confidence 
      interval {CI}: 0.31-0.89]; P = 0.017) than children without obesity, with 
      schoolchildren who consume more sweets per day (OR = 1.65 [95% CI: 1.03-2.62]; 
      P = 0.035) more likely to present caries than schoolchildren who consume fewer 
      sweets per day. CONCLUSION: Children with obesity are less likely to present 
      dental caries. Comprehensive strategies aimed at risk factors can be useful in 
      controlling nutritional status and improving oral health.

      Children.

LID - 10.1089/met.2021.0048 [doi]
AB  - Background: Childhood overweight and obesity are among the major public health 
      problems worldwide. In Mexico, it has been reported in 2018 that 35.6% of 
      children between 5 and 11 years old were overweight or obese. Central obesity is 
      associated with the development of different complications, such as 
      cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). An important tool used to evaluate obesity is the 
      waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and values higher than 0.5 suggest the existence of 
      cardiovascular risk (CVR). The aim of this study was to evaluate CVR by the WHtR 
      in school-age children from Yucatan, Mexico. Methods: This study included a 
      sample of school-age children between the ages of 10 and 13 years from public 
      schools in Yucatan, Mexico. Anthropometric parameters such as body weight, 
      height, body mass index z-score (zBMI), waist circumference, WHtR, and CVR were 
      evaluated. Results: A total of 2559 children with a median age of 12.1 ± 0.57 
      years old were evaluated. The classification by height z score showed that 26.8% 
      were of short height, 73.1% were of normal height, and 0.1% were of tall height. 
      The prevalence of body weight excess determined by zBMI was 48%. The prevalence 
      of normal weight was 44%, and the prevalence of body weight deficiencies was 8%. 
      The CVR determined by WHtR was 47.5%. In the population with obesity, 63.3% had 
      an increased risk of CVDs and 30.7% had a very high risk. Moreover, it was 
      observed that 13.2% of the population with normal weight had an increased risk of 
      CVDs. Conclusion: One out of two child 10 to 13 years of age is overweight or 
      obese as defined with zBMI in Mexico. According to WHtR, almost half of this 
      population is at increased CVR, while near two-third of child with obesity are at 
      high or very high CVR.

TI  - Metabolic and genetic markers' associations with elevated levels of alanine 
      aminotransferase in adolescents.
PG  - 407-414

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic 
      liver disease in adolescents, is a feature of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Obesity 
      and insulin resistance (IR) are risk factors for NAFLD, as well as 
      inflammation-related genetic markers. The relationship between metabolic or 
      inflammation-related genetic markers and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is not 
      fully understood. We examined the relationship of MetS, metabolic and 
      inflammation-related genetic markers with elevated ALT in adolescents. METHODS: A 
      total of 674 adolescents participated in a cross-sectional study in Guadalajara, 
      Mexico. Elevated ALT (>40 IU/L), a surrogate marker of NAFLD, and MetS 
      (International Diabetes Federation definition) were evaluated. Obesity, IR, 
      lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP) and genetic markers (TNFA-308G>A, CRP+1444C>T, 
      IL1RN and IL6-597/-572/-174 haplotype) were evaluated. Multivariate logistic 
      regression was performed. RESULTS: Elevated ALT was observed in 3% and 14.1% 
      (total and obese, respectively) of the adolescents. Obesity (odds ratio [OR], 
      5.86; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.16-25.89), insulin (OR, 8.51; 95% CI, 
      2.61-27.71), IR (OR, 9.10; 95% CI, 2.82-29.38), total cholesterol (TC) (OR, 3.67; 
      95% CI, 1.25-10.72), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (OR, 3.06; 95% 
      CI, 1.06-8.33), non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (OR, 3.88; 95% 
      CI, 1.27-11.90) and IL1RN (OR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.10-19.53) were associated with 
      elevated ALT. Among males, ≥2 MetS criteria were associated with elevated ALT 
      (OR, 4.22; 95% CI, 1.14-15.71). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, insulin, IR, high TC, high 
      LDL-C, high non-HDL-C and IL1RN polymorphism were associated with elevated ALT. 
      Among males, ≥2 MetS criteria were associated with elevated ALT. There is an 
      urgent need to reduce obesity and IR in adolescents to prevent NAFLD.

AB  - Introduction. Increase in body weight is a gradual process that usually begins in 
      childhood and in adolescence as a result of multiple interactions among 
      environmental and genetic factors. This study aimed to analyze the relationship 
      between copy number variants (CNVs) in five genes and four intergenic regions 
      with obesity in Mexican children. Methods. We studied 1423 children aged 6-12 
      years. Anthropometric measurements and blood levels of biochemical parameters 
      were obtained. Identification of CNVs was performed by real-time PCR. The effect 
      of CNVs on obesity or body composition was assessed using regression models 
      adjusted for age, gender, and family history of obesity. Results. Gains in copy 
      numbers of LEPR and NEGR1 were associated with decreased body mass index (BMI), 
      waist circumference (WC), and risk of abdominal obesity, whereas gain in ARHGEF4 
      and CPXCR1 and the intergenic regions 12q15c, 15q21.1a, and 22q11.21d and losses 
      in INS were associated with increased BMI and WC. Conclusion. Our results 
      indicate a possible contribution of CNVs in LEPR, NEGR1, ARHGEF4, and CPXCR1 and 
      the intergenic regions 12q15c, 15q21.1a, and 22q11.21d to the development of 
      obesity, particularly abdominal obesity in Mexican children.

LID - 77
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Down syndrome (DS) is associated with various congenital anomalies 
      and metabolic alterations, such as dyslipidemias, that can lead to cardiovascular 
      disease in adulthood. This study was designed to describe the lipid 
      concentrations and the frequency of dyslipidemias in children with DS. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: The sample included 386 patients, 52.4% male. The study was carried 
      out on children with DS, aged 2-18 years old, who were patients at the Mexican 
      National Institute of Pediatrics between May 2016 and June 2017. Their height and 
      weight were recorded, and their serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and 
      triglyceride levels were determined. RESULTS: Of the total patients included, 
      57.5% had some type of dyslipidemia, 32.6% isolated and 24.9% combined. The most 
      common alteration, considering both isolated and combined dyslipidemias, was low 
      HDL, in 45.9%, followed by hypertriglyceridemia, in 26.2%. Among those with 
      combined dyslipidemia, high TG with low HDL-c was the most common, in 17.9%. A 
      significant association was found between dyslipidemia and obesity, as well as 
      between dyslipidemia and central obesity. The percentiles of lipid values are 
      reported. CONCLUSION: The presence of an unfavorable lipid profile is common in 
      pediatric patients with Down syndrome, especially low HDL cholesterol and high 
      triglycerides.

      schoolchildren from Arandas, Jalisco, Mexico].
PG  - 472-480
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2015, Mexico was the top country for childhood obesity. The 
      objective was to identify the association between physical activity and sedentary 
      lifestyle with the social and demographic characteristics of families of 
      schoolchildren in Arandas, Jalisco, Mexico. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 
      192 schoolchildren were randomly selected. Body mass index (BMI), active and 
      sedentary behaviors, and socio-demographic characteristics of families were 
      obtained. Logistic regression models with the included variables were 
      constructed. RESULTS: Males living in not-crowding houses [OR 6.12 (2.17-17.25), 
      p = 0.001], whose mothers were housewives [OR 2.44 (1.00, 5.94), p = 0.05], 
      practiced more physical activity. Active transport to school was more common in 
      schoolchildren whose fathers had lower income [OR 3.13 (1.27, 7.7), p = 0.013] 
      and employment as peasant or mason [OR 5.12 (1.13, 23.3), p = 0.034]. 
      Schoolchildren of nuclear families spent more hours watching television [OR 2.69 
      (1.10, 6.58), p = 0.03]. The frequency of outdoor playing was higher in males 
      whose fathers had unstable employment [OR 2.93 (1.06, 8.1), p = 0.038] and low 
      education [OR 2.94 (0.96, 8.98), p = 0.059]. CONCLUSION: Families with lower 
      socioeconomic strata (less educated parents, unstable employment and family 
      overcrowding) are more associated with active activities that do not require 
      active economic spending.

      106 obese and 119 with normal weight were included. MetS was defined by the 
      presence of 3 or more of the following: obesity as a body mass index ≥ 95th 
      percentile, fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL, triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, high density 
      lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL-c)<40 mg/dL and systolic and diastolic blood 
      pressure ≥ 95th percentile. RESULTS: We found MetS components in both groups. 
      Most frequent abnormalities in the obese group included increased levels of 
      HDL-c, triglycerides, fasting glucose and total cholesterol, while increased 
      levels of glucose and total cholesterol, and lower HDL-c levels predominated in 
      the normal weight group. The prevalence of MetS in the obese group was 44.3% and, 
      in normal weight children, it was 0.84%. The 3 main components that defined the 
      MetS in the obese group were obesity/triglycerides/HDL-c (34.0%), 
      obesity/glucose/triglycerides/HDL-c (29.8%) and obesity/glucose/HDL-c (14.9%), 
      while the only combination observed in the normal weight group was 
      glucose/HDL-c/triglycerides. CONCLUSION: A percentage of 44.3 of obese school 
      children had MetS, and dyslipidemia showed to be strong determinants of MetS. 
      Although the prevalence of MetS was low in children with normal weight, one third 
      of them showed one of the components of MetS.

TI  - Performance of Waist-To-Height Ratio, Waist Circumference, and Body Mass Index in 
      Discriminating Cardio-Metabolic Risk Factors in a Sample of School-Aged Mexican 
      Children.

AB  - The most common tools used to screen for abdominal obesity are waist 
      circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR); the latter may represent a 
      more suitable tool for the general non-professional population. The objective of 
      this study was to evaluate the association of WHtR, WC, and body mass index with 
      lipidic and non-lipidic cardio-metabolic risk factors and the prediction 
      capability of each adiposity indicator in a sample of school-aged Mexican 
      children. Overall, 125 children aged 6 to 12 years were analyzed. Anthropometric, 
      biochemical, and dietary parameters were assessed. Receiving operating 
      characteristic (ROC) analysis and univariate and multivariate linear and logistic 
      regression analyses were performed. All the three adiposity indicators showed 
      significant areas under the ROC curve (AURC) greater than 0.68 for high 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), triglycerides, and atherogenic index 
      of plasma, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). A significant 
      increased risk of having LDL-c ≥ 3.4 mmol/L was observed among children with WHtR 
      ≥ 0.5 as compared to those with WHtR < 0.5 (odds ratio, OR: 2.82; 95% confidence 
      interval, CI: 0.75⁻7.68; p = 0.003). Fasting plasma glucose was not associated 
      with any of the adiposity parameters. WHtR performed similarly to WC and z-BMI in 
      predicting lipidic cardio-metabolic risk factors; however, a WHtR ≥ 0.5 was 
      superior in detecting an increased risk of elevated LDL-c.

TI  - Is store density associated with sugar-sweetened beverages consumption and 
      overweight or obesity in Mexican adolescents?
PG  - e12838
LID - 10.1111/ijpo.12838 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is a risk factor 
      for obesity. In Mexico, SSBs are widely available and consumed daily by 
      adolescents. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to estimate the indirect 
      association between store density (including grocery, convenience, non-alcoholic 
      beverage stores and supermarkets) and overweight or obesity (OW/O) among Mexican 
      adolescents, using SSB consumption as a mediator. METHODS: We used 
      cross-sectional data on adolescent SSB consumption, weight status (body mass 
      index for age [BMI for age]), physical activity, screen time and sociodemographic 
      factors from the 2016 Mexican Midway National Health and Nutrition Survey 
      (ENSANUT MC 2016). The National Statistical Directory of Economic Units provided 
      information on stores selling SSBs. We estimated structural equations models to 
      test associations between store density and OW/O, using SSB consumption as a 
      mediator. RESULTS: We found a direct positive association between store density 
      and SSB intake in adolescents (β =1.229), including density of supermarkets 
      (β = 132.07), grocery stores (β = 1.170) and non-alcoholic beverage stores 
      (β = 1.537). No significant association was observed for convenience stores. 
      Direct association between store density and OW/O was strongest for supermarket 
      density (β = 0.426). In addition, SSB intake was significantly associated with 
      OW/O (p = 0.033). No significant indirect association between density of any 
      store and OW/O was found. CONCLUSIONS: Store density was directly associated with 
      SSB consumption but not indirectly associated with OW/O mediated by SSB. Further 
      research on food environment is required in order to design evidence-based 
      strategies aimed at reducing SSB intake and OW/O in adolescents.

AB  - This study examined the association between intestinal lactobacilli and obesity 
      dependent on dietary patterns in children. A cross-sectional study was conducted 
      including 1111 children, 6-12 years old. Obesity was determined according to the 
      WHO cut-off points. Diet information from a Food Frequency Questionnaire 
      identified three dietary patterns. Lactobacillus sp. were determined by a 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The consumption of complex 
      carbohydrates and a high abundance of L. paracasei were associated with a lower 
      risk of obesity (0.35, Confidence Interval 95% 0.19-0.65). The same happened with 
      a medium consumption of fats and a medium abundance of L. paracasei (0.43, CI95% 
      0.24-0.78). In contrast, an increased risk of obesity is observed with a medium 
      and high consumption of simple carbohydrates (2.37, CI95% 1.29-4.34 and 2.52, 
      CI95% 1.36-4.66, respectively, p-trend<0.05), and low consumption of complex 
      carbohydrates (2.49, CI95% 1.35-4.58), in the presence of a high relative 
      abundance of L. reuteri. A high relative abundance of L. paracasei decreased the 
      risk of obesity, even when high-fat and simple carbohydrate diets were consumed; 
      while a high relative abundance of L. reuteri was associated with a greater 
      possibility of obesity with these types of diets. Our results provide evidence of 
      diet implication in metabolism regulators like lactobacilli. This is helpful in 
      strategies development to promote healthy diets during early stages of life.

      15th-85th percentile). Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) with TaqMan probes. The cross-sectional study was carried out 
      using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for gender. 
      RESULTS: FTO-SNP rs1421085 showed significant differences between children with 
      obesity and children with normal weight for the heterozygous genotype (P = 0.003) 
      and for allele frequencies (P = 0.023). Adjusting by gender, significant 
      differences were found in frequencies of the hetezygous genotype of SNPs 
      rs9939609 (P = 0.023) and rs1421085 (P = 0.003) as well as in allele frequencies 
      (P = 0.042 and P = 0.013, respectively) between girls with obesity and girls 
      without obesity. In contrast, SNP rs8057044 was significantly different only 
      between heterozygous overweight versus normal weight boys (P = 0.035) and for the 
      allele frequency of rs8057044 (P = 0.021). The mean relative CNV was 
      significantly higher in male overweight children than in boys with normal weight 
      (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The FTO SNP rs1421085 is a genetic factor associated 
      with obesity in Mayan school-aged children. FTO SNPs rs1421085 and rs9939609 
      affect genetic susceptibility for obesity only in girls, whereas, SNP rs8057044 
      and CNV are associated with overweight status only in boys.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mexico is experiencing an epidemic of childhood obesity and 
      overweight, the factors that determine type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
      diseases. Even though variants in genes such as MC4R, LEP, LEPR, and FTO have 
      been associated with the risk of obesity, in Mexico the level of miscegenation is 
      heterogeneous, so this risk must be measured as genetic ancestry. This study 
      aimed at evaluating the association between common SNPs in FTO and MC4R genes in 
      Mexican children with Amerindian, mestizo and predominance European ancestry. 
      METHODS: Anthropometric data and fasting blood samples were collected from 718 
      unrelated Mexican school children aged 4-13 years old. Variants in the FTO, MC4R, 
      LEP, LEPR genes and 15 ancestry informative markers (AIMs), were genotyped using 
      allelic discrimination assays. RESULTS: High triglycerides and low cholesterol 
      HDL were the most frequent metabolic alterations. The prevalence of minor allele 
      frequency of polymorphism rs8050136, rs9939609, and rs3751812 in the FTO gene; 
      and rs17782313 of MC4R gene were found to be significantly higher among Mexican 
      children with a predominance of European ancestry (EA) compared to native Mexican 
      children (Amerindian predominance), X(2) test, p < 0.05. The FTO (rs8050136, 
      rs9939609) and MC4R (rs17782313) genotypes also were significantly associated 
      with obesity (BMI > 2Z) in boys (OR=1.89, P=0.04, OR=3.3, P=0.006 OR=3.11, 
      p=0.04, respectively). Children with AA genotype (minor) of rs8050136 and 
      rs9939609 SNPs have higher triglycerides in relation to native ancestral 
      genotypes. CONCLUSION: Risk variants in the FTO and MC4R genes had a higher 
      frequency in children with EA compared with Amerindian predominance children, 
      showing that miscegenation is associated with the frequency of obesity-related 
      genotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-grade inflammation is the link between obesity and insulin 
      resistance. Because physiologic insulin resistance occurs at puberty, obese 
      pubertal children are at higher risk for insulin resistance. Excessive diets in 
      refined carbohydrates and saturated fats are risk factors for insulin resistance, 
      but calcium, magnesium, vitamin-D, and the omega-3 fatty acids likely protect 
      against inflammation and insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: To analyze interactions 
      among dietary saturated fat, refined carbohydrates, calcium, magnesium, vitamin 
      D, and omega-3 fatty acids on the risk of inflammation and insulin resistance in 
      a sample of prepubertal and pubertal children. METHODS: A sample of 229 children 
      from Mexico City was analyzed in a cross-sectional design. Anthropometric 
      measurements, 24 h recall questionnaires, and blood samples were obtained. Serum 
      insulin, glucose, calcium, magnesium, 25-OHD3, C-reactive protein, leptin, 
      adiponectin, and erythrocytes fatty acids were measured. Parametric and 
      nonparametric statistics were used for analysis. RESULTS: While mean 
      macronutrients intake was excessive, micronutrients intake was deficient (P < 
      0.01). Inflammation determinants were central obesity and magnesium-deficient 
      diets. Determinants of insulin resistance were carbohydrates intake and 
      circulating magnesium and adiponectin. CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium-deficient diets are 
      determinants of inflammation, while high intake of refined carbohydrates is a 
      risk factor for insulin resistance, independently of central adiposity.

      risk in a sample of Mexican children.
PG  - 1068-1073
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2017.28 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Few studies in Latin American paediatric populations have 
      differentiated fat deposits in specific areas, such as intra-abdominal fat (IAF) 
      and subcutaneous abdominal fat (SAF). Research in diverse populations is needed, 
      as patterns of fat accumulation vary by ethnicity. The aim of this study was to 
      determine whether IAF and/or SAF are related to cardiometabolic risk factors, 
      independent of total body fat (TBF), in a group of Mexican schoolchildren. 
      SUBJECTS/METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Mexico City with 94 
      children aged between 5 and 11 years. IAF and SAF were assessed by magnetic 
      resonance using two different estimation methods: (a) at the midpoint of lumbar 
      vertebras 4 and 5 (L4-L5) and (b) the sum of the areas of four slices (L1-L2, 
      L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5, which will be referred to as 'total' IAF and SAF). TBF 
      was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The following cardiometabolic 
      risk factors were assessed: total cholesterol, low-density 
      lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, high-density 
      lipoprotein-cholesterol, blood pressure, insulin resistance, number of risk 
      factors and metabolic syndrome score. RESULTS: After adjusting for sex, age and 
      TBF, total SAF was related to the number of cardiometabolic risk factors and 
      metabolic syndrome score. Although IAF at L4-L5 was also related to the number of 
      cardiometabolic risk factors, there was evidence of collinearity with TBF. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of Mexican schoolchildren, TBF and SAF, but not IAF, 
      were associated with higher cardiometabolic risk.

AB  - High concentrations of carotenoids are protective against cardiometabolic risk 
      traits (CMTs) in adults and children. We recently showed in non-diabetic Mexican 
      American (MA) children that serum α-carotene and β-carotene are inversely 
      correlated with obesity measures and triglycerides and positively with HDL 
      cholesterol and that they were under strong genetic influences. Additionally, we 
      previously described a Pediatric Metabolic Index (PMI) that helps in the 
      identification of children who are at risk for cardiometabolic diseases. Here, we 
      quantified serum lycopene and β-cryptoxanthin concentrations in approximately 580 
      children from MA families using an ultraperformance liquid 
      chromatography-photodiode array and determined their heritabilities and 
      correlations with CMTs. Using response surface methodology (RSM), we determined 
      two-way interactions of carotenoids and PMI on Matsuda insulin sensitivity index 
      (ISI). The concentrations of lycopene and β-cryptoxanthin were highly heritable 
      [h(2) = 0.98, P = 7 × 10(-18) and h(2) = 0.58, P = 1 × 10(-7)]. We found 
      significant (P ≤ 0.05) negative phenotypic correlations between β-cryptoxanthin 
      and five CMTs: body mass index (- 0.22), waist circumference (- 0.25), 
      triglycerides (- 0.18), fat mass (- 0.23), fasting glucose (- 0.09), and positive 
      correlations with HDL cholesterol (0.29). In contrast, lycopene only showed a 
      significant negative correlation with fasting glucose (- 0.08) and a positive 
      correlation with HDL cholesterol (0.18). Importantly, we found that common 
      genetic influences significantly contributed to the observed phenotypic 
      correlations. RSM showed that increased serum concentrations of α- and 
      β-carotenoids rather than that of β-cryptoxanthin or lycopene had maximal effects 
      on ISI. In summary, our findings suggest that the serum carotenoids are under 
      strong additive genetic influences and may have differential effects on 
      susceptibility to CMTs in children.

      children.
PG  - 690-5
LID - 10.1002/ajhb.22298 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Childhood obesity remains a problem among Latino children in the 
      United States. Acculturation to an American diet and sedentary lifestyle may be 
      causative factors. The research purpose was to assess child growth status, 
      including sitting height, in relation to acculturation among Mexican and 
      Mexican-American children. METHODS: Anthropometric measures of weight, height, 
      and sitting height were taken in a cross-sectional survey of Mexican and 
      Mexican-American elementary school children (N = 484) in Phoenix, Arizona. 
      Height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and body mass index (BMI) Z-scores 
      were calculated based on the Centers for Disease Control 2000 growth reference. 
      Sitting height Z-scores (SHZ) were determined from the NHANES III reference 
      values. Questions about language usage were asked of the children as a proxy for 
      acculturation. Differences in growth measures and acculturation between those 
      born in the United States or Mexico were evaluated by chi-square or t-tests. 
      RESULTS: The mean HAZ value (-0.23) was close to the reference median. There were 
      no significant differences in HAZ or SHZ by birth country or gender. WAZ values 
      for boys were significantly higher than for girls. More girls (64%) than boys 
      (54%) had normal BMIs. More Mexican-born boys (28%) were obese than Mexican-born 
      girls (17%; P = 0.026) in comparison to the US-born boys (31%) and girls (24%; P 
      = n.s.). Acculturation scale score and male gender predicted a small percentage 
      of the variation in BMIZ. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental and cultural factors that 
      promote obesity among low-income Mexican and Mexican-American children are 
      similar regardless of birth country but boys may be at greater risk of obesity 
      than girls.

LID - 10.1002/oby.21159 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity before pregnancy is associated with a greater risk for the 
      offspring to develop obesity and diabetes in childhood and adulthood. The aim of 
      the present study was to determine the association between maternal overweight or 
      obesity before pregnancy and newborn oxidative stress (OS). METHODS: Seventy-two 
      mother-child pairs were divided according to the pre-gestational body mass index 
      (BMI) of the mothers as follows: eutrophic (n = 21), overweight (n = 32), and 
      obese (n = 19). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured in the 
      plasma of a blood sample from the newborn's umbilical cord. RESULTS: The MDA 
      levels of newborns increased with maternal BMI (P = 0.001), as did the levels of 
      NO (P = 0.019). There was a direct correlation between MDA and NO levels in each 
      of the three groups (eutrophic: R(2)  = 0.59, P < 0.001; overweight: R(2) 
       = 0.45, P < 0.001; and obese: R(2)  = 0.26, P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal 
      overweight and obesity before pregnancy are associated with increased OS in the 
      offspring.

TI  - Decreased GlycA after lifestyle intervention among obese, prediabetic adolescent 
      Latinos.
PG  - 186-193
LID - S1933-2874(18)30409-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jacl.2018.09.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obese youth with prediabetes are at increased risk for premature 
      morbidity and mortality through multiple mechanisms, including increased systemic 
      inflammation. GlycA is a novel measure of systemic inflammation that predicts 
      type II diabetes, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in adults. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to examine changes in GlycA after 
      lifestyle intervention among obese, prediabetic Latino youth. METHODS: Obese, 
      prediabetic Latino youth (n = 27; 15.5 ± 1.1 years, 13 males/14 females) 
      completed a 12-week lifestyle intervention that included weekly nutrition 
      education and 3 d/wk of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Prediabetes was 
      characterized by an expanded definition of impaired glucose tolerance, using 
      2-hour glucose ≥120 mg/dL after an oral glucose tolerance test. GlycA was 
      assessed at baseline and 12 weeks using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. 
      RESULTS: After the lifestyle intervention, GlycA was significantly reduced 
      (445.3 ± 51.3 μmol/L to 419.0 ± 50.0 μmol/L, P = .01) (mean ± standard 
      deviation). Additional improvements were observed in multiple cardiovascular risk 
      factors, including body mass index (BMI; 34.8 ± 5.0 kg/m(2) to 
      34.0 ± 5.1 kg/m(2), P < .001), total cholesterol (154.1 ± 30.3 mg/dL to 
      143.3 ± 29.1 mg/dL, P = .003), and 2-hour glucose (141.0 ± 13.2 mg/dL to 
      115.9 ± 31.4 mg/dL, P < .001). Decreases in GlycA were associated with decreases 
      in 2-hour glucose (r = 0.49, P = .008) and BMI (r = 0.41, P = .03). CONCLUSION: 
      These data are consistent with the hypothesis that lifestyle intervention might 
      improve GlycA levels in obese, prediabetic adolescent Latinos, but randomized 
      trial evidence is needed. Healthy lifestyle modifications among high-risk youth 
      may decrease future risk of cardiometabolic disease through reducing systemic 
      inflammation, in addition to improving traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate association of dietary patterns with metabolic syndrome 
      (MetS) and metabolic markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 654 adolescents from 
      Guadalajara, Jalisco, participated in a cross-sectional study. Diet was evaluated 
      using a food frequency questionnaire; 24 food groups were integrated, and dietary 
      patterns were derived using cluster analysis. MetS was defined according to 
      International Diabetes Federation (IDF), Cook and colleagues, Ford and 
      colleagues, and de Ferranti and colleagues criteria. RESULTS: Dietary patterns 
      identified were: "DP1", "DP2", and "DP3". Among males, "DP3" was associated with 
      MetS (Cook and collaborators) (OR, 12.14; 95%CI, 1.66-89.05), 
      hypertriglyceridemia (OR, 3.89; 95%CI, 1.01-15.07), and insulin resistance (OR, 
      6.66; 95%CI, 1.12-39.70). "DP2" was associated with abdominal obesity (OR, 5.11; 
      95%CI, 1.57-16.66). CONCLUSIONS: "DP3" entertained a greater risk of MetS, 
      hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance, while "DP2" possessed a greater 
      risk of abdominal obesity among adolescent males.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of chronic diseases (CDs) in the pediatric population 
      has increased due to technological advances that decrease mortality and increase 
      survival. AIM OF THE STUDY: To compare the frequency of cardiometabolic factors 
      (CFs) among pediatric patients with CDs with those among children with obesity 
      and overweight without CDs. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study. 
      Pediatric patients from 6-17 years of age were included. A total of 333 patients 
      with CD were studied, and of these patients, 77 had difficult-to-control 
      epilepsy, 183 had chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 73 underwent kidney 
      transplants; in addition, a comparison group was included, consisting of 286 
      overweight and obese children without any other pathologies. We performed 
      anthropometry, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, and lipid profiling on all of 
      the patients. Statistical analysis was conducted as follows: Chi(2) tests were 
      used to compare the CFs between the groups. RESULTS: We included 619 patients 
      from 6-17 years old. Patients with CDs had a low frequency of obesity (12.4%) but 
      a high frequency of the remaining CFs. Hypertriglyceridemia (65%), 
      hypoalphalipoproteinemia (49%) and systemic arterial hypertension (46.5%) were 
      the most common CFs, particularly among subjects with CKD and kidney 
      transplantation. When comparing the frequencies of these CFs with those in the 
      obesity/overweight group, hypertriglyceridemia (p <0.05) was more common in 
      patients with CDs. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CDs, dyslipidemia, hypertension, 
      and hyperglycemia occur at frequencies that are the same as or higher than those 
      in overweight/obese children, but when the CD patients are overweight/obese, it 
      increases their frequency.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate children's risk of being overweight associated with 
      maternal underestimation of weight status and health behaviors. RESULTS: One 
      hundred forty mother-child dyads were included. Children whose weight status was 
      underestimated by their mothers were at greater risks of being overweight 
      compared to those whose weigh status was correctly perceived (adjusted OR 2.31, 
      95% CI 1.11-4.81). Less television viewing time was associated with a 63% reduced 
      risk of being overweight (adjusted OR .37, 95% CI .17-.83). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal 
      underestimation of weight status was common among overweight and normal-weight 
      children, and it was associated with an increased children's risk of being 
      overweight.

TI  - Body Mass Index in Mother and Child Dyads and its Association With Household Size 
      and Parents' Education in 2 Urban Settings of Yucatan, Mexico.
PG  - 383-392
LID - 10.1177/0379572119842990 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overweight/obesity (OW/OB) coexists in mother-child dyads. However, a 
      dearth of evidence on the factors associated with this phenomenon calls for 
      research. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of sociodemographic factors with 
      OW/OB in a sample of 260 Maya mother-child dyads from Yucatan, Mexico. METHODS: 
      During 2011 to 2014, we measured height and weight in children and their mothers 
      and calculated their body mass index (BMI). The OW/OB cutoff points were defined, 
      for mothers, as having a BMI >25 kg/m(2) and, for children, as having a 
      BMI-for-age >2 standard deviation of the World Health Organization references. 
      Mother-child dyads were grouped according to their BMI status: (1) normal weight 
      mother and child, (2) normal weight mother and OW/OB child, (3) OW/OB mother and 
      normal weight child, and (4) OW/OB mother and child. A multinomial logistic 
      regression model was used to analyze the interrelationships among BMI status in 
      mother-child dyads, household size, and parental education. RESULTS: 
      Overweight/obesity coexisted in 40% of dyads. Compared to normal weight dyads 
      (1), each unit increase in household size and in years of maternal education 
      decreased the risks of the coexistence of OW/OB in mother-child dyads (odds ratio 
      [OR] = 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.94, P = .015; OR = 0.70, 95% CI 
      0.52-0.94, P = .019, respectively). Conversely, each year increase in paternal 
      education increased the risk for OW/OB in dyads (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.08-1.99, P = 
      .015). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that household size and parental education 
      contribute to shape BMI-based nutritional status in this sample of mother-child 
      dyads.

LID - 10.1007/s10903-013-9879-4 [doi]
AB  - The purpose was to compare maternal perceptions, feeding practices, and 
      overweight status of children in immigrant households in California (US) with a 
      cohort in Guanajuato, Mexico (MX). In 2006, staff interviewed mothers and weighed 
      and measured their children, 1-6 years (US: n = 95 and MX: n = 200). Prevalence 
      of overweight [body mass index z-score (BMIZ) >1.0 and <1.65] and obesity (BMIZ > 
      1.65) was 21.1 and 28.4% in the US respectively, compared to 11.5 and 12.9% in MX 
      (p < 0.001). No differences were observed in maternal ability to identify 
      correctly the child's weight status or ever being told the child was overweight. 
      US children ate away from home more often (p < 0.0001), had fewer family meals (p 
      < 0.0001), and played outdoors less often than MX children (p < 0.0002). Further 
      analyses should examine how differences in eating and activity patterns explain 
      the disparity in childhood obesity across the countries.

AB  - Some comorbidities are risk factors for severe coronavirus disease (Covid-19) but 
      it is unknown whether some increase susceptibility to Covid-19 in children. In 
      this Mexican case-control study, contact with patients with Covid-19, or having

      independently increased the risk for Covid-19 in the whole sample analysis. 
      However, only contact history and obesity remained statistically significant in 
      the separated analysis of girls and boys. The results suggest that obesity is not 
      only associated with severe disease but also increases risk for Covid-19. 
      Contrary to findings in adults, no difference between cases and controls was 
      found for gender, presence of pneumonia or surrogates of severe disease including 
      admission to intensive care unit, tracheal intubation or whether patient had 
      died. This indicates that Covid-19 is less severe in children than adults. Future 
      research is needed to establish the mechanisms involved in obesity and Covid-19 
      in children.

AB  - Excessive weight gain and obesity are major public health concerns. Childhood 
      obesity is growing at an alarming rate. Polymorphisms in the Calpain-10 gene and 
      the reduced expression of this gene in muscle cells and adipocytes have been 
      associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in several 
      populations. In the present study, we explored the contribution of Calpain-10 in 
      the development of metabolic impairment in childhood. We evaluated the presence 
      of risk polymorphisms in the CAPN10 gene (SNP-44, SNP-43, InDel-19 and SNP-63) 
      and the associated changes in the Calpain-10 mRNA levels in a pediatric 
      population. A total of 161 Mexican children between 4 and 18 years old were 
      included in this study. This population was classified into three groups 
      according to international growth references: healthy weight (HW), overweight 
      (OW) and obese (OB). Association studies of the anthropometric data, clinical 
      values, genotyping and expression assays showed a decrease in the Calpain-10 mRNA 
      and protein expression in the OW and OB groups with respect to the HW group. This 
      decrease in the Calpain-10 mRNA expression was more evident in individuals 
      homozygous for SNP-44 (T/T) and InDel-19 (3/3), alone (p<0.001 and p=0.015, 
      respectively) or in combination (p=0.017). These polymorphisms were also 
      associated with elevated BMI, weight percentiles, z-scores, waist circumferences, 
      fasting glucose levels and beta cell functions in the OW and OB groups (p<0.05). 
      Moreover, our results indicate a statistically significant decrease in the 
      expression of the 75-kDa Calpain-10 isoform in the OW+OB group. The presence of 
      polymorphisms and alterations in the expression of the CAPN10 gene at early ages 
      might result in metabolic impairment in adulthood and should be further 
      investigated.

TI  - The Role of Hyperinsulinemia in Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis.
PG  - 413-417
LID - 10.1097/BPO.0000000000001557 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity in the prepuberal stage has been directly associated with 
      slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Serum insulin level increases in the 
      prepuberal and adolescence stage, to a greater extent in the obese population. 
      The main objective of this article was to analyze the relationship between 
      insulin levels and SCFE. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted between 
      January 2018 and April 2019. The study group was formed with patients with SCFE 
      and the control group with patients from the pediatric obesity clinic of our 
      hospital selected during their initial evaluation. None were being treated for 
      obesity. Anthropometric measurements of size, weight, waist circumference, and 
      blood pressure were taken. Body mass index (BMI) and waist-height index of all 
      patients were calculated. According to BMI for age, they were classified as 
      normal, overweight, or obese. Serum determinations of glucose, insulin, glycated 
      hemoglobin, lipid profile, and complete blood count were analyzed. Insulin 
      resistance was diagnosed with Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) >3. Insulin 
      levels >13 U/mL for girls and >17 U/mL for boys were considered as 
      hyperinsulinemia. RESULTS: We studied 14 patients with SCFE and 23 in the control 
      group. The mean age and BMI in both groups were similar. The elevation of serum 
      insulin was significantly higher in the SCFE group (P=0.001) as was HOMA 
      (P=0.005). Triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein were higher in the SCFE 
      group (P=0.037 and 0.009, respectively). Glycemia, glycated hemoglobin, total 
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and neutrophils 
      showed no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCFE showed elevated 
      levels of insulin, HOMA, triglycerides, and very-low-density lipoprotein, even 
      higher than the control group. Our study demonstrates a significant association 
      between abnormally high serum insulin levels and SCFE. The known effects of 
      insulin on growth cartilage may explain the physeal mechanical insufficiency to 
      support the abnormally high or repetitive loads in accelerated growth stages that 
      lead to SCFE. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-case-control, prognostic study.

TI  - Predictive polymorphisms for breast cancer in postmenopausal Mexican women.
PG  - 640-646
LID - 10.4103/0973-1482.179109 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Several factors contribute to the increase in breast cancer (BC) 
      incidence, such as lifetime exposure to estrogen, early menarche and older ages 
      at first birth, menopause, and the increased prevalence of postmenopausal 
      obesity. In fact, there is an association between an increased BC risk and 
      elevated estrogen levels, which may be involved in carcinogenesis via the 
      estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) encoded by the ESR1 gene. Interestingly, there is 
      an antagonistic relationship between ERα and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) 
      in BC cells. AIMS: Herein, we explore the combined effects of the ESR1 (XbaI, 
      PvuII) and AhR polymorphisms on BC development in Mexican women according to 
      their menopausal status. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Investigation was performed using a 
      cases and controls design. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a group of 96 cases diagnosed 
      with BC and 111 healthy women, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms ESR1 (XbaI, 
      PvuII) and AhR gene were identified by qPCR. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: 
      Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used. Statistical analyses were 
      conducted using the STATA statistical package (Version 10.1, STATA Corp., College 
      Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: The G/G XbaI genotype was more prevalent in the cases 
      than in the controls (P = 0.008). Moreover, Mexican women carrying the XbaI (wild 
      type [WT]/G or G/G) ESR1 genotype have higher risk (12.26-fold) for developing 
      postmenopausal BC than individuals carrying the WT/WT genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      presence of the G/G genotype of XbaI may be considered a susceptibility allele in 
      Mexican women. Due to increased postmenopausal BC risk, the XbaI (WT/G or G/G) 
      alleles may be used as a postmenopausal predictive factor for BC in Mexican 
      women.

AB  - The impact of nutritional status at diagnosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic 
      leukemia (ALL) on survival rates was assessed in a Hispanic cohort. Children 
      <16 years with newly diagnosed ALL-B from 2011 to 2019 were studied. Overweight 
      and obesity were classified by body mass index (BMI) and Z-score according to WHO 
      and CDC criteria. BMI, weight percentiles for age and Z-Score were assessed using 
      the WHO Anthro (0-5 years) and AnthroPlus (5-19 years) programs. Cox model was 
      used to estimate risk factors for relapse and death; differences between groups 
      were assessed with Student's T test for parametric and Mann-Whitney U test for 
      non-parametric variables. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) 
      were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method, calculating time, status, cumulative 
      survival and standard error with a 95% confidence interval. Equal data 
      distribution was estimated with the log-rank test. One-hundred and seventy-two 
      B-ALL children were studied. The overweight-obese group had a non-significant 
      lower DFS (CDC: 54% vs. 60%, p = 0.80; WHO: 57% vs. 64%, p = 0.89) and OS rate 
      (CDC:76% vs. 82%, p = 0.38; WHO:65% vs. 81%, p = 0.13). An association between 
      nutritional status determined by CDC and WHO criteria at diagnosis of B-cell ALL 
      and survival rates was not documented.

AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and correlations of 
      components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) using the International Diabetes 
      Federation (IDF) pediatric definition in a cross-sectional study of 215 
      overweight/obese Mexican children aged 6 to 12. There are no previous studies of 
      this kind in Mexican children. Clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory 
      measurements were performed. The prevalence of MetS using the pediatric IDF 
      criteria was 6.7% (95% confidence interval, 4.0-11.1). A higher proportion of 
      children in the younger age group had waist circumference above the cutoff, while 
      a higher proportion in the older age group had hyperglycemia. Children with MetS 
      had higher percentages of body fat, body mass index, total cholesterol, and 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Increased triglycerides, decreased 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and waist circumference were most highly 
      associated with MetS. This has significant implications for public health.

TI  - Appetitive traits in children aged 6 to 12 years: association with obesity and 
      differences by gender.
PG  - 83-89
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity in schoolchildren are a major public health 
      problem in Mexico. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the association 
      of appetitive traits with the presence of obesity and identify gender differences 
      in children attending a university hospital. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted on 176 children with obesity and 175 children with normal weight in the 
      outpatient clinic of the Nuevo Hospital Civil de Guadalajara. The body mass index 
      (BMI) of the participants was calculated. The parents completed the Children's 
      Eating Behaviour Questionnaire to measure eight appetitive traits. The mean 
      appetitive trait scores were compared between children with obesity and normal 
      weight, and between genders. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's 
      t-tests for independent samples and regression analysis between appetite traits 
      and BMI Z-scores. RESULTS: The mean food responsiveness score (or food onset 
      appetitive trait) was higher in children with obesity (p < 0.001), while the mean 
      satiety responsiveness (or food offset trait) was higher in children with normal 
      weight (p < 0.001). Normal weight males showed higher scores for Food 
      responsiveness, Emotional over-eating, and Desire to drink (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Children with obesity show appetitive traits that could lead to 
      higher food consumption. Normal weight males showed appetitive traits that could 
      represent a risk of developing obesity.

AB  - We aimed to estimate the population fraction of poor early child health and 
      developmental outcomes attributable to maternal depressive symptoms (DS) 
      contrasting it between low- and middle/high-income households. We used a 
      nationally representative probabilistic sample of 4240 children younger than 
      5 years old and their mothers, derived from the Mexican National Health and 
      Nutrition Survey Data (ENSANUT 2012). Complex survey design, sampling, and 
      analytic weights were taken into account in analyses. DS was measured by CESD-7. 
      Child outcomes were as follows: breastfeeding, attending well-child check-ups, 
      respiratory disease, diarrhea and general health problems, immunization, 
      accidents, growth, obesity, and food insecurity. Prevalence of DS among mothers 
      was 21.36%. In low-SES households, DS was associated with higher risk of never 
      being breastfed (RR = 1.77; p < .05), health problems (RR = 1.37; p < .05), acute 
      respiratory disease (RR = 1.51; p < .05), accidents requiring child 
      hospitalization (RR = 2.16; p < .01), and moderate or severe food insecurity 
      (RR = 1.58; p < .001). In medium- or high-SES households, DS was associated with 
      higher risk of never attending a developmental check-up (RR = 2.14; p < .05) and 
      moderate or severe food insecurity (RR = 1.75; p < .01). Population risks 
      attributable to DS ranged from 2.30 to 17.45%. Prevention of DS could lead to 
      reduction of problematic early childhood outcomes in both low and medium/high 
      SES.

TI  - A Genetic Risk Score Improves the Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in 
      Mexican Youths but Has Lower Predictive Utility Compared With Non-Genetic 
      Factors.
PG  - 647864
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2021.647864 [doi]
LID - 647864
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a multifactorial disease caused by a complex 
      interplay between environmental risk factors and genetic predisposition. To date, 
      a total of 10 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) have been associated with 
      pediatric-onset T2D in Mexicans, with a small individual effect size. A genetic 
      risk score (GRS) that combines these SNPs could serve as a predictor of the risk 
      for pediatric-onset T2D. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical utility of a GRS that 
      combines 10 SNPs to improve risk prediction of pediatric-onset T2D in Mexicans. 
      METHODS: This case-control study included 97 individuals with pediatric-onset T2D 
      and 84 controls below 18 years old without T2D. Information regarding family 
      history of T2D, demographics, perinatal risk factors, anthropometric 
      measurements, biochemical variables, lifestyle, and fitness scores were then 
      obtained. Moreover, 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously 
      associated with pediatric-onset T2D in Mexicans were genotyped. The GRS was 
      calculated by summing the 10 risk alleles. Pediatric-onset T2D risk variance was 
      assessed using multivariable logistic regression models and the area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The body mass index 
      Z-score (Z-BMI) [odds ratio (OR) = 1.7; p = 0.009] and maternal history of T2D 
      (OR = 7.1; p < 0.001) were found to be independently associated with 
      pediatric-onset T2D. No association with other clinical risk factors was 
      observed. The GRS also showed a significant association with pediatric-onset T2D 
      (OR = 1.3 per risk allele; p = 0.006). The GRS, clinical risk factors, and GRS 
      plus clinical risk factors had an AUC of 0.66 (95% CI 0.56-0.75), 0.72 (95% CI 
      0.62-0.81), and 0.78 (95% CI 0.70-0.87), respectively (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The 
      GRS based on 10 SNPs was associated with pediatric-onset T2D in Mexicans and 
      improved its prediction with modest significance. However, clinical factors, such 
      the Z-BMI and family history of T2D, continue to have the highest predictive 
      utility in this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity during childhood is a risk factor for developing 
      cardiovascular diseases during adulthood. AIM: To measure insulin and glucose 
      levels and parameters of insulin resistance in obese, overweight and normal 
      weight Mexican children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Comparative study of 21 obese 
      children with a body mass index (BMI) over percentile 95, aged 10 ± 1 years (10 
      males), 14 children aged 10 ± 2 (7 males) with a BMI between percentiles 85 and 
      94 and 16 children aged 9 ± 2 years (3 males) with a body mass index between 
      percentiles 10 and 84. Body weight, blood pressure and waist circumference were 
      measured and a blood sample was obtained to measure fasting glucose and insulin 
      levels. Homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA) and quantitative insulin 
      sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated. RESULTS: Among obese, 
      overweight and normal weight children, insulin levels were 14.9 (95% CI 
      10.90-18.99), 7.20 (CI 5.12-9.28) and 4.73 (CI 95% 1.92-7.53) uU/ml, 
      respectively. The figures for HOMA were 3.16 (95% CI 2.20-4.12), 1.49 (95% CI 
      1.03-1.94) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.35-1.60), respectively. The figures for QUICKI were 
      0.331 (95% CI 0.319-0.343), 0.371 (95% CI 0.349-0.393) and 0.419 (95% CI 
      0.391-0.446), respectively. Compared to their normal weight counterparts, the 
      risk of obese children and those with a waist circumference over percentile 90 of 
      having a HOMA over 3.16 was 17 and 10 times higher, respectively. BMI correlated 
      better than waist circumference with insulin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Obese children 
      have higher levels of insulin resistance than their normal weight counterparts.

      obese children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Department of Pediatrics 
      of Regional Hospital N∘ 1 of Mexican Institute of Social Security in Morelia, 
      Michoacán, Mexico. PARTICIPANTS: 79 obese and 64 non-obese children between the 
      ages of 5 and 10 years. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Obese children (body mass index 
      [BMI] >85 in growth curves for Centers for Disease Control/National Center for 
      Health Statistics), and the control group of 64 non-obese children (percentile 
      <85), % body fat, platelet activation was assessed by sP-selectin. Other measures 
      were leptin, uric acid (UA), von Willebrand Factor (vWF), plasminogen activator 
      inhibitor (PAI-1), lipid profile, and glucose. RESULTS: Obese children displayed 
      higher plasma sP-selectin, leptin, PAI-1, and vWF than non-obese children. In the 
      univariate logistic regression analysis, leptin, vWF, UA, and high density 
      lipoprotein (HDL), but not with PAI-1, were factors associated with platelet 
      activation. By stepwise linear regression analysis adjusted by sex and age, the 
      best predictor variables for platelet activation were leptin (β:0.381; t:4.665; 
      P=0.0001), vWF (β:0.211; t:2.926; P=0.004), UA (β:0.166; t:2.146; P=0.034), and 
      HDL (β:-0.215; t:-2.819; P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Obese children have a higher risk 
      of developing early platelet activation. Factors associated with platelet 
      activation were Leptin, vWF, UA, and HDL. Further studies involving larger 
      numbers of patients over a longer duration are needed to understand the possible 
      molecular mechanism underlying the association between leptin, vWF, and UA and 
      endothelial activation and/or endothelial damage/dysfunction in obese children 
      and its influence in cardiovascular disease in adults.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity is considered an epidemic condition. It is related to the 
      increased prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases, but there are no studies 
      in the Mexican paediatric population on its relationship with sleep disorders. 
      AIM OF THE STUDY: We sought to determine the prevalence of sleep disorders in 
      paediatrics, as well as factors for their development. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An 
      observational, analytical, retrospective study, was performed including patients 
      aged 2 to 16 years, between March 2019-2021. The Paediatric Sleep Questionnaire 
      was used to assess the presence of sleep disorders. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients 
      were included, 27 (42.18%) of whom had sleep disorder criteria. Among these, 
      obesity, i.e. weight percentile ≥ 75 and body mass index percentile ≥ 93.5, was 
      a risk factor. Normal weight was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in paediatric 
      patients may favour the appearance of sleep disorders; screening could favour 
      early diagnosis, correct treatment, and better life quality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mexico occupies one of the first places worldwide in childhood 
      obesity. Its Mestizo and Indigenous communities present different levels of 
      westernization which have triggered different epidemiological diseases. We 
      assessed the effects of a multi-component school-based intervention program on 
      obesity, cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors. METHODS: A physical activity, 
      health education and parent involvement (PAHEPI) program was developed and 
      applied in six urban (Mestizo ethnic group) and indigenous (Seri and Yaqui ethnic 
      groups) primary schools for 12 weeks. A total of 320 children aged 4-12 years 
      participated in intervention program; 203 under Treatment 1 (PAHEPI program) and 
      117, only from Mestizo groups, under Treatment 2 (PAHEPI+ school meals). For Body 
      Mass Index (BMI), cardiovascular and diabetes factors, pairwise comparisons of 
      values at baseline and after treatments were done using Wilcoxon signed rank 
      test. Generalized linear models were applied to assess the intervention effect by 
      age, sex and nutritional status in relation to ethnicity and treatment. RESULTS: 
      We observed improvements on BMI in children with overweight-obesity and in 
      triglycerides in the three ethnic groups. The Mestizo ethnic group showed the 
      largest improvements under Treatment 2. While Seris showed improvements only in 
      cardiovascular risk factors, Yaquis also showed improvements in diabetes risk 
      factors, though not in BMI. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the same 
      intervention may have positive but different effects in different ethnic groups 
      depending on their lifestyle and their emerging epidemiological disease. 
      Including this type of intervention as part of the school curriculum would allow 
      to adapt to ethnic group in order to contribute more efficiently to child 
      welfare. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was retrospectively registered under the 
      identifier NCT03768245 .

TI  - Maternal obesity leads to long-term altered levels of plasma ceramides in the 
      offspring as revealed by a longitudinal lipidomic study in children.
PG  - 1231-1243
LID - 10.1038/s41366-018-0291-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of 
      obesity and other symptoms of the metabolic syndrome in the offspring. 
      Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms and cellular factors underlying this 
      enhanced disease susceptibility remain to be determined. Here, we aimed at 
      identifying changes in plasma lipids in offspring of obese mothers that might 
      underpin, and serve as early biomarkers of, their enhanced metabolic disease 
      risk. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We performed a longitudinal lipidomic profiling in plasma 
      samples from normal weight, overweight, and obese pregnant women and their 
      children that participated in the Prenatal Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation, 
      Growth, and Development trial conducted in Mexico. At recruitment women were aged 
      between 18 and 35 years and in week 18-22 of pregnancy. Blood samples were 
      collected at term delivery by venipuncture from mothers and from the umbilical 
      cord of their newborns and from the same infants at 4 years old under non-fasting 
      conditions. Lipidomic profiling was done using ultra-performance liquid 
      chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Analysis of the 
      lipidomic data showed that overweight and obese mothers exhibited a significant 
      reduction in the total abundance of ceramides (Cer) in plasma, mainly of Cer 
      (d18:1/20:0), Cer (d18:1/22:0), Cer (d18:1/23:0), and Cer (d18:1/24:0), compared 
      with mothers of normal body weight. This reduction was confirmed by the direct 
      quantification of these and other ceramide species. Similar quantitative 
      differences in the plasma concentration of Cer (d18:1/22:0), Cer (d18:1/23:0), 
      and Cer (d18:1/24:0), were also found between 4-year-old children of overweight 
      and obese mothers compared with children of mothers of normal body weight. 
      Noteworthy, children exhibited equal daily amounts of energy and food intake 
      independently of the BMI of their mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal obesity results 
      in long-lasting changes in plasma ceramides in the offspring suggesting that 
      these lipids might be used as early predictors of metabolic disease risk due to 
      maternal obesity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of chronic-degenerative diseases secondary to 
      obesity in early infancy has alerted health providers to the importance of 
      identifying the risk factors for obesity and assessing preventive treatment to 
      reduce risks. Studies performed on a pediatric population have examined the role 
      of inflammatory biomarkers (specifically CRP and TNF-α) and adiposity with 
      inconsistent results. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between the serum 
      levels of C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-alfa with adiposity 
      measured by bioimpedance analysis in schoolchildren. METHODS: Cross sectional 
      design. Data were collected from 74 schoolchildren randomly selected in a local 
      primary school in the city of Colima, Mexico. The mean age was 9.4 years (1.5, 
      SD); 33 (44.6%) were girls. The adiposity (percentage of fat mass) was measured 
      using bioimpedance analysis and anthropometric measurements. Serum C-reactive 
      protein and tumor necrosis factor alpha were determined with enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. The association between adiposity and serum inflammatory 
      biomarkers was assessed with non parametric tests (Mann Whitney and Kruskall 
      Wallis tests), and parametric tests (Pearson's correlation). RESULTS: Children 
      with obesity had a significantly higher level of C-reactive protein [2.90 mg/L 
      (0.07-9.37)] compared with children with a normal percentage of fat mass [0.71 
      mg/L (0.07-5.75)] (p < 0.001). No differences between groups were identified 
      regarding serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alfa. Modest correlations were 
      identified between serum levels of C-reactive protein, adiposity determined by 
      bioimpedance analysis (r = 0.453, p < 0.001); body mass index (r = 0.398, p = 
      0.001); triceps skinfold (r = 0.369, p = 0.002); and subescapular skinfold (r = 
      0.405, p < 0.001). No correlation was found between adiposity and serum tumor 
      necrosis factor-alfa. CONCLUSION: Subclinical inflammation manifested by higher 
      serum levels of C-reactive protein was identified in schoolchildren with higher 
      percentage of fat mass as determined by bioimpedance analysis and other 
      anthropometric measurements.

PG  - 465-472
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has serious health 
      implications and upward trends of the disease, accompanied by the obesity 
      epidemic worldwide. OBJECTIVE: To screen for fatty liver in overweight and obese 
      children and evaluate the factors associated with an increased likelihood of 
      presenting a positive-screen result. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional 
      study, 102 children were recruited at a secondary care medical unit. Serum 
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were quantified and hepatic ultrasounds 
      were performed; multiple logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors 
      associated with the increased odds of presenting with NAFLD (fatty infiltration 
      on ultrasound and ALT > 52 U/L for boys and > 44 U/L for girls). RESULTS: The 
      overall prevalence of NAFLD was 10.8%. In multivariate analysis, a waist-to-hip 
      ratio ≥ 1 was associated with increased odds of screening positive for NAFLD 
      (odds ratio (OR) = 4.96, 95% CI 1.17-20.90). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate 
      that one out of ten children with overweight or obesity has data suggestive of 
      NAFLD and is at risk of presenting its consequences on health.

TI  - A greater birthweight increases the risk of acute leukemias in Mexican 
      children-experience from the Mexican Interinstitutional Group for the 
      Identification of the Causes of Childhood Leukemia (MIGICCL).
PG  - 1528-1536
LID - 10.1002/cam4.1414 [doi]
AB  - In Mexico, due to the high rates of diabetes, overweight, and obesity, there has 
      also been noted an increased newborn weight, which may be contributing to the 
      elevated incidence rate of childhood acute leukemia (AL). We conducted a 
      case-control study in public hospitals of Mexico City aimed to know whether a 
      greater weight at birth is associated with a higher risk of developing leukemia. 
      We included incident cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute 
      myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosed between 2010 and 2015. Controls were 
      frequency-matched to the cases by age, sex, and health institution. Logistic 
      regression analysis was performed adjusting risks by child's sex, overcrowding 
      index, birth order, and mother's age at the time of pregnancy. Adjusted odds 
      ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. A total of 1455 cases 
      and 1455 controls were included. An evident association between ALL and child's 
      birthweight ≥2500 g was found (aOR 2.06; 95% CI: 1.59, 2.66) and also, in those 
      with birthweight ≥3500 g (aOR 1.19; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.41). In AML patients with 
      birthweight ≥2500 g and ≥3500 g, an aOR of 1.77 (95% CI: 1.07, 2.94) and 1.42 
      (95% CI: 1.03-1.95) was observed, respectively. No association was noticed with 
      either type of AL and a birthweight ≥4000 g. To sum up, we found a moderate 
      association between not having a low birthweight and an increased risk of acute 
      leukemias. Birthweight ≥3500 g was also a risk factor for both types of leukemia. 
      This suggests that a greater birthweight may increase the risk of acute leukemias 
      in Mexican children.

TI  - Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pediatric population of a 
      third-level care hospital in Mexico City in 2013 and 2018.
PG  - 290-298
LID - 10.4239/wjd.v14.i3.290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is a state of hyperglycemia due to a 
      defect in the secretion and/or action of insulin, and it represents the most 
      common form of diabetes worldwide. In Mexico, 10.3% of the adult population have 
      been diagnosed with T2DM and it is expanding to the pediatric population. AIM: To 
      evaluate and compare the prevalence of T2DM in the pediatric population at the 
      Children's Hospital, "Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez (HIMFG)", at two 
      time periods: 2013 vs 2018. METHODS: A comparison of two cross-sectional studies 
      was done (2013 and 2018). The study population was comprised of children and 
      adolescents 8-17 years old, from the Diabetes Clinic at the aforementioned 
      institution. A comprehensive interrogation regarding family history and perinatal 
      antecedents was performed. Complete blood work after 12 h of fasting was obtained 
      to determine serum levels of glucose, glycated hemoglobin, lipid profile, 
      C-peptide, and insulin. The data were analysed using the statistical software 
      package SPSS v. 23.0. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically 
      significant. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were included: 47 from 2013, and 
      104 from 2018. There were age differences noted between the two periods with 
      younger patients presenting T2DM in 2013. Also, T2DM predominated in the male sex 
      in 55.36% in 2013 vs 32.7% in 2018. An increased prevalence of T2DM was noted 
      from 2013 to 2018 (20.2% vs 33.0%, respectively), which was a statistically 
      significant 12.8% increase (P < 0.0001). The illness phenotype was more 
      aggressive in the 2018 group with the presence of a higher proportion of obesity, 
      insulin resistance, and adverse lipid profiles. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of 
      T2DM at the HIMFG institution from 2013 to 2018 increased by 12.8% (20.2% vs 
      33.0%, respectively). The study results demonstrate the need for vigilance in 
      T2DM trends, and to strengthen programs of healthy nutrition and physical 
      activity as well as early detection and risk factors for obesity, data on insulin 
      resistance, and metabolic syndrome, with the aim of preventing the development of 
      T2DM.

TI  - The school health index as an impetus for change.
PG  - A19
LID - A19
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increase in childhood obesity and prevalence of chronic disease 
      risk factors demonstrate the importance of creating healthy school environments. 
      As part of the Border Health Strategic Initiative, the School Health Index was 
      implemented in public schools in two counties along the Arizona, United 
      States-Sonora, Mexico border. Developed in 2000 by the Centers for Disease 
      Control and Prevention, the School Health Index offers a guide to assist schools 
      in evaluating and improving opportunities for physical activity and good 
      nutrition for their students. CONTEXT: Between 2000 and 2003, a total of 13 
      schools from five school districts in two counties participated in the School 
      Health Index project despite academic pressures and limited resources. METHODS: 
      The Border Health Strategic Initiative supported the hiring and training of an 
      external coordinator in each county who was not part of the school system but who 
      was an employee in an established community-based organization. The coordinators 
      worked with the schools to implement the School Health Index, to develop action 
      plans, and to monitor progress toward these goals. CONSEQUENCES: The School 
      Health Index process and school team participation varied from school to school. 
      Individual plans were different but all focused on reducing in-school access to 
      unhealthy foods, identified as high-fat and/or of low nutritional value. Ideas 
      for acting on this focus ranged from changing the content of school lunches to 
      discontinuing the use of nonnutritious foods as classroom rewards. All plans 
      included recommendations that could be implemented immediately as well as those 
      that would require planning and perhaps the formation and assistance of a 
      subcommittee (e.g., for developing or adopting a district-wide health 
      curriculum). INTERPRETATION: After working with the School Health Index, most 
      schools made at least one immediate change in their school environments. The 
      external coordinator was essential to keeping the School Health Index results and 
      action plans on the agendas of school administrators, especially during periods 
      of staff turnover. Staff turnover, lack of time, and limited resources resulted 
      in few schools achieving longer-term policy changes.

PG  - S58-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular risk (CVR) is increasing and it is related to life 
      style and dietary habits; one of the age groups at risk of developing this 
      disease are the obese children. The objective of this study was to assess the CVR 
      in the obese pediatric population in a secondary care unit of the Instituto 
      Mexicano del Seguro Social in San Luis Potosí, México. METHODS: A cross-sectional 
      study, in which we used Alústiza's scale to measure CVR. We included the total of 
      cases of pediatric obese population in a year. We performed the analysis by each 
      of the variables included in the scale (age, sex, body mass index, family history 
      of diabetes and obesity, alcohol, blood pressure, cholesterol). High CVR was 
      correlated to HDL and glucose, through a statistical analysis with chi-squared. 
      RESULTS: We reviewed a total of 100 medical records of children from 6 to 15 
      years (52 girls, 48 boys). CVR was low in 26 %, moderate in 14 % and higher in 60 
      %. A positive history of obesity was found in 26 %; obesity plus diabetes, 16 %; 
      obesity and dyslipidemia, 13 %; hypertension, 11 %. None of the children 
      practiced excercise. We found hypercholesterolemia in 46 %, and hyperglycemia in 
      34 %. By using chi-squared we found that all variables were statistically 
      significant (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Validated scales are useful to measure 
      CVR in children, in order to take action in a timely fashion and avoid the 
      persistence of risk in adulthood.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Abdominal fat, particularly visceral, is associated with a high 
      risk of metabolic complications. The waist-height ratio (WHtR) is used to assess 
      abdominal fat in individuals of all ages. OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of 
      the waist-to-height ratio to detect metabolic risk in mexican schoolchildren. 
      PATIENTS AND METHOD: A study was conducted on children between 6 and 12 years. 
      Obesity was diagnosed as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 85th percentile, and an ICE 
      ≥0.5 was considered abdominal obesity. Blood levels of glucose, cholesterol and 
      triglycerides were measured. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
      and negative value, area under curve, the positive likelihood ratio and negative 
      likelihood ratio of the WHtR and BMI were calculated in order to identify 
      metabolic alterations. WHtR and BMI were compared to determine which had the best 
      diagnostic efficiency. RESULTS: Of the 223 children included in the study, 51 had 
      hypertriglyceridaemia, 27 with hypercholesterolaemia, and 9 with hyperglycaemia. 
      On comparing the diagnostic efficiency of WHtR with that of BMI, there was a 
      sensitivity of 100% vs. 56% for hyperglycaemia, 93 vs. 70% for cholesterol, and 
      76 vs. 59% for hypertriglyceridaemia. The specificity, negative predictive value, 
      positive predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, 
      and area under curve were also higher for WHtR. CONCLUSIONS: The WHtR is a more 
      efficient indicator than BMI in identifying metabolic risk in mexican school-age.

TI  - [Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in children].
PG  - S110-4
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common cause of 
      liver disease in children and adolescents in the United States of America (USA) 
      and probably in the entire western hemisphere, due to the increase in the 
      prevalence of overweight and obesity. Steatosis can progress to inflammation, 
      fibrosis and even cirrhosis, which increases the morbidity and mortality 
      associated to liver disease. In every overweight and obese child a thorough 
      analysis should be performed including liver function tests and liver ultrasound, 
      in order to establish a timely diagnosis. The liver biopsy is the most specific 
      study to rule out other potentially treatable entities. It is necessary to count 
      on non-invasive methods to detect children with NAFLD and identify those in risk 
      of progression. Biomarkers related to inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis 
      and fibrosis have been reported. The main goal of the treatment is to modify the 
      life style, starting with a healthy diet and an increase of physical activity. 
      Regarding pharmacological treatment, there is evidence of histological 
      improvement with vitamin E use, as opposed to metformin, but more conclusive 
      studies regarding this subject are needed.

TI  - Associations of common variants in the SLC16A11, TCF7L2, and ABCA1 genes with 
      pediatric-onset type 2 diabetes and related glycemic traits in families: A 
      case-control and case-parent trio study.
PG  - 824-831
LID - 10.1111/pedi.12497 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence of associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related glycemic traits in adults, but 
      there is a little information about such associations in youths. OBJECTIVE: The 
      aim of this study was to evaluate the associations of SNPs in the TCF7L2, 
      SLC16A11, and ABCA1 genes with T2D and related glycemic traits in Mexican 
      children and adolescents. SUBJECTS: A total of 99 families with children with T2D 
      (n = 327) and 83 families with children without the disease (n = 212). METHODS: 
      The associations between SNPs of TCF7L2 (rs7903146 and rs12255372), SLC16A11 
      (rs13342232), and ABCA1 (rs9282541) with T2D were analyzed. We also evaluated the 
      effects of SNPs on quantitatively related glycemic traits after adjusting for 
      age, sex, and the presence of overweight or obesity. RESULTS: The G allele of 
      SLC16A1 /rs13342232 was associated with T2D in adults (adjusted odds ratio 
      [ORadj] = 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18; 3.06) and children 
      (ORadj = 1.94; 95% CI: 1.25; 3.00). In addition, the combined analysis of 
      case-control and case-parent trio was also significant (OR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.12; 
      1.74). After adjusting for known confounding factors, we found a significant 
      association between TCF7L2/rs122555372 and C-peptide (β = -0.76, P = .005) in 
      patients with diabetes and between fasting glucose (β = 2.05, P = .039) and 
      homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function (β = -32.14, P = .025) levels in 
      individuals without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that SLC16A1 
      /rs13342232 might be involved in the risk of pediatric-onset T2D in Mexican 
      families. Moreover, TCF7L2/rs122555372 was associated with pancreatic reserve in 
      patients with T2D and with fasting glucose and β-cell function in individuals 
      without diabetes.

PG  - 692-697
LID - 10.20960/nh.03044 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: many obese children will be obese adults unless they adopt and 
      maintain healthy eating and physical activity patterns. Anxiety has been 
      described in overweight and obese children with dysfunctional family 
      environments, with impact on their quality of life; risk for some eating disorder 
      was also found. Objective: to identify anxiety in the presence of food in 
      schoolchildren in Baja California Sur. Material and methods: a cross-sectional 
      study in 406 schoolchildren, from 8 to 13 years of age, was performed: 
      nutritional status calculation, measurements of attitudes towards food (cut-off 
      point > 20), socioeconomic level, type of family, and intake of junk food were 
      collected. Descriptive statistics and association measures were performed using 
      Student's t-test and the chi-squared test. Parents provided their informed 
      consent, and children provided their assent. Results: a total of 406 
      schoolchildren were evaluated, with ages of 10.4 ± 1.2. Of these, 53 % had 
      healthy weight, 44 % had overweight or obesity, and 3 % were underweight. 
      Functional families predominated at 67 %. A middle socioeconomic level was found 
      in 64 %. In all, 94 % consumed junk food. There is an association between anxiety 
      in the presence of food and socioeconomic status, and anxiety in the presence of 
      food and nutritional status (p = 0.01). In overweight and obese schoolchildren no 
      association was found between study variables. There is anxiety in the presence 
      of food in 40 % of the sample due to external factors, in 5 % because of 
      tiredness or boredom, in 11 % because of negative feelings. Conclusion: there is 
      an association between anxiety, socioeconomic status, and nutritional status. 
      Anxiety in the presence of food occurred in 54.7 % of cases.

TI  - Maternal short stature does not predict their children's fatness indicators in a 
      nutritional dual-burden sample of urban Mexican Maya.
PG  - 627-34
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.22463 [doi]
AB  - The co-existence of very short stature due to poor chronic environment in early 
      life and obesity is becoming a public health concern in rapidly transitioning 
      populations with high levels of poverty. Individuals who have very short stature 
      seem to be at an increased risk of obesity in times of relative caloric 
      abundance. Increasing evidence shows that an individual is influenced by 
      exposures in previous generations. This study assesses whether maternal poor 
      early life environment predicts her child's adiposity using cross sectional 
      design on Maya schoolchildren aged 7-9 and their mothers (n = 57 pairs). We 
      compared maternal chronic early life environment (stature) with her child's 
      adiposity (body mass index [BMI] z-score, waist circumference z-score, and 
      percentage body fat) using multiple linear regression, controlling for the 
      child's own environmental exposures (household sanitation and maternal parity). 
      The research was performed in the south of Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, a low 
      socioeconomic urban area in an upper middle income country. The Maya mothers were 
      very short, with a mean stature of 147 cm. The children had fairly high adiposity 
      levels, with BMI and waist circumference z-scores above the reference median. 
      Maternal stature did not significantly predict any child adiposity indicator. 
      There does not appear to be an intergenerational component of maternal early life 
      chronic under-nutrition on her child's obesity risk within this free living 
      population living in poverty. These results suggest that the co-existence of very 
      short stature and obesity appears to be primarily due to exposures and 
      experiences within a generation rather than across generations.

      children.
PG  - 330-336
LID - 10.1111/ijpo.12147 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for the development of 
      several diseases. The genetic component of hypertriglyceridemia has been studied 
      in adults, but little is known in children. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to 
      evaluate the association of two variants in APOA5 (rs662799) and APOA1 (rs5072) 
      with triglyceride (TG) levels in Mexican children. METHODS: Anthropometric 
      parameters were measured in 1559 Mexican children 5-14 years of age. DNA was 
      isolated from blood samples. Lipid profiles and glucose concentrations were 
      determined from serum and genotyping of rs662799, and rs5072 was performed using 
      TaqMan® technology. Additive and dominant models adjusted for age, gender and 
      body mass index were used to evaluate the association of these single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms with TG levels. RESULTS: Children with high TG levels were found to 
      have a higher body mass index and waist circumference as well as a worse lipids 
      profile and glucose levels (p < 0.001). Additive and dominant models demonstrated 
      a significant association between the rs662799 and rs5072 with TG. The dominant 
      model showed the strongest significant association (OR = 1.81; 95% CI 1.46-2.24; 
      p = 5.40 × 10(-08) for rs662799 and OR = 1.54; 95% CI 1.05-2.25; 
      p = 2.60 × 10(-02) for rs5072). CONCLUSION: The minor alleles of rs662799 (APOA5) 
      and rs5072 (APOA1) modulate TG levels in Mexican children.

TI  - Environmental and personal correlates of fruit and vegetable consumption in low 
      income, urban Mexican children.
PG  - 63-71
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2007.00839.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence suggests that populations with high fruit 
      and vegetable (FV) consumption have a lower risk for childhood obesity, cancer 
      and cardiovascular diseases. There are no studies that address the correlates of 
      FV intake in Mexican children; therefore, the aim of this study was to identify 
      the frequency of FV consumption by children in Mexico City's low income state 
      schools and their personal (preferences, expectancy, knowledge and self-efficacy) 
      and environmental (accessibility and person in charge of cooking at home) 
      correlates. METHODS: A validated questionnaire to assess accessibility, 
      expectancy, self-efficacy, preference and knowledge; and a 2-day dietary recall 
      were used to assess the FV intake and its correlates in 327 children. Statistical 
      analysis included chi-square and stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Average 
      consumption of FV was once a day with a higher proportion of girls consuming FV 3 
      or more times per day (15.2% versus 6.7%; P < 0.01). The environmental factors 
      that influenced a higher consumption of FV were the mother being responsible for 
      cooking at home (P < 0.02) and accessibility to FV (P < 0.01); whereas the 
      personal factors were self-efficacy (P < 0.05) and preference (P < 0.03) to 
      vegetables. CONCLUSION: Correlates of fruit and vegetable consumption in children 
      from Mexico City's State Schools were being female and accessibility to fruits 
      and vegetables. Home and school environments are decisive for the children to 
      increase FV consumption. Creative ways to encourage FV consumption in boys should 
      be explored. These factors should be considered when designing programmes aimed 
      at increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables in children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of hypomagnesemia with prehypertension 
      (preHTN) and hypertension in children. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 3954 apparently 
      healthy Mexican children were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Exclusion 
      criteria were type 2 diabetes; hepatic, renal, or endocrine disease; impaired 
      fasting glucose; chronic diarrhea; and intake of vitamins or magnesium 
      supplements in the previous 6 months. preHTN was defined by systolic and/or 
      diastolic blood pressure ≥90th to <95th percentile and hypertension by systolic 
      and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥95th percentile, according to age, sex, and 
      height percentile. Hypomagnesemia was defined by serum magnesium concentration 
      <1.8 mg/dL (<0.74 mmol/L). To control for potential sources of bias related to 
      age, participants were allocated into 2 groups, aged 6-10 years and 11-15 years. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of preHTN and hypertension was 12.2% and 6.4%, 
      respectively, in children aged 6-10 years and 13.9% and 10.6% in those aged 
      11-15 years. Hypomagnesemia was identified in 59 children with preHTN (27.3%) and 
      52 (45.6%) with hypertension in the 6-10 year age group, and in 115 children with 
      preHTN (36.0%) and 109 (49.6%) with hypertension in the 11-15 year age group. 
      Adjusted multiple logistic regression analysis showed that in children in both 
      age groups, hypomagnesemia was associated with both preHTN (6-10 years: OR, 2.18, 
      P < .0005; 11-15 years: OR, 1.38, P = .018) and hypertension (6-10 years: OR, 
      4.87, P < .0005; 11-15 years: OR, 1.83, P = .0002). CONCLUSION: Our results 
      indicate that serum magnesium level <1.8 mg/dL is significantly associated with 
      preHTN and hypertension in apparently healthy children.

TI  - Tackling inequalities in obesity: a protocol for a systematic review of the 
      effectiveness of public health interventions at reducing socioeconomic 
      inequalities in obesity amongst children.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/2046-4053-1-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of the impact of overweight and obesity on 
      short- and long-term functioning, health and well-being. Internationally, 
      childhood obesity rates continue to rise in some countries (for example, Mexico, 
      India, China and Canada), although there is emerging evidence of a slowing of 
      this increase or a plateauing in some age groups. In most European countries, the 
      United States and Australia, however, socioeconomic inequalities in relation to 
      obesity and risk factors for obesity are widening. Addressing inequalities in 
      obesity, therefore, has a very high profile on the public health and health 
      services agendas. However, there is a lack of accessible policy-ready evidence on 
      what works in terms of interventions to reduce inequalities in obesity. METHODS 
      AND DESIGN: This article describes the protocol for a National Health Service 
      Trust (NHS) National Institute for Health Research-funded systematic review of 
      public health interventions at the individual, community and societal levels 
      which might reduce socioeconomic inequalities in relation to obesity amongst 
      children ages 0 to 18 years. The studies will be selected only if (1) they 
      included a primary outcome that is a proxy for body fatness and (2) examined 
      differential effects with regard to socioeconomic status (education, income, 
      occupation, social class, deprivation and poverty) or the intervention was 
      targeted specifically at disadvantaged groups (for example, children of the 
      unemployed, lone parents, low income and so on) or at people who live in deprived 
      areas. A rigorous and inclusive international literature search will be conducted 
      for randomised and nonrandomised controlled trials, prospective and retrospective 
      cohort studies (with and/or without control groups) and prospective repeat 
      cross-sectional studies (with and/or without control groups). The following 
      electronic databases will be searched: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Social 
      Science Citation Index, ASSIA, IBSS, Sociological Abstracts and the NHS Economic 
      Evaluation Database. Database searches will be supplemented with website and grey 
      literature searches. No studies will be excluded on the basis of language, 
      country of origin or publication date. Study inclusion, data extraction and 
      quality appraisal will be conducted by two reviewers. Meta-analysis and narrative 
      synthesis will be conducted. The main analysis will examine the effects of (1) 
      individual, (2) community and (3) societal level public health interventions on 
      socioeconomic inequalities in childhood obesity. Interventions will be 
      characterised by their level of action and their approach to tackling 
      inequalities. Contextual information on how such public health interventions are 
      organised, implemented and delivered will also be examined. DISCUSSION: In this 
      review, we consider public health strategies which reduce and prevent 
      inequalities in the prevalence of childhood obesity, highlight any gaps in the 
      evidence base and seek to establish how such public health interventions are 
      organised, implemented and delivered. PROSPERO registration number: 
      CRD42011001740.

TI  - Biocultural aspects of obesity in young Mexican schoolchildren.
PG  - 446-60
AB  - Obesity related to over-nutrition is investigated in a sample of 219 Mexican 
      children from affluent families, ages 6-12 years. Defined as weight-for-age at or 
      above the 95(th) percentile, obesity rates in middle childhood are very high in 
      this population, being 24.2% of children (29.4% of boys and 19.1% of girls). 
      Binary logistic regression shows that children are more likely to be obese if 
      they are boys, from small households with few or no other children, and have more 
      permissive, less authoritarian parents. Diet at school and activity patterns, 
      including television viewing, are not different for boys and girls and so do not 
      explain this gender variation. The value placed on children, especially sons, in 
      smaller middle-class families, can result in indulgent feeding because food 
      treats are a cultural index of parental caring. Parents also value child fatness 
      as a sign of health. These obese Mexican children have no greater social problems 
      (peer rejection or stigma) or psychological problems (anxiety, depression, or low 
      self esteem) than their non-obese peers. More study specifically focused on 
      feeding practices in the home environment is required to explain very high rates 
      of child obesity. The differences in obesity risk related to specific aspects of 
      children's developmental microniche emphasize the importance of including a focus 
      on gender as a socio-ecological construct in human biological studies of child 
      growth, development, and nutrition.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obesity is a complex, chronic, and multifactorial disease 
      that has become a major, and worldwide, public health problem contributing to an 
      increased number of pathologies, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular 
      disease, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, thus suggesting a commolon 
      origin. A diet high in sugar and fats coupled with a sedentary lifestyle has a 
      major role in the development of obesity. However, the genetic background has 
      also been associated with body fat accumulation. The aim of this study was to 
      assess the effect ofACE-rs4646994, APOA5-rs662799, and MTP-rs1800591 gene 
      polymorphisms on clinical and biochemical parameters and to evaluate the 
      association with body phenotypes in children and adolescent population of 
      Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico. METHODS: Anthropometric, clinical, biochemical 
      parameters and BMI were obtained from 405 children and adolescents. The BMI was 
      used to determine the body phenotype. The rs4646994 gene polymorphism was 
      determined by PCR, whereas rs662799 and rs1800591 were determined by PCR-RFLP. 
      The obtained results were analyzed to determine their association of these single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms with body phenotype and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: 
      TT genotype for APOA5-rs662799 was associated with increased levels of HDL-C in 
      the analyzed population (p <0.05). The ACErs4646994gene polymorphism is 
      associated with high Insulin levels, HOMAIR index, and triglyceride levels, 
      mainly when presenting a I/I genotype (p <0.05). CONCLUSION: The polymorphic 
      allele of the ACE gene is capable of modulating triglyceride levels, insulin 
      levels and HOMA-IR index in the evaluated population; it must be highlighted that 
      this has not been reported in other studied populations elsewhere.

AB  - Gut metagenome in pediatric subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type-2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been poorly studied, despite an alarming worldwide 
      increase in the prevalence and incidence of obesity and MetS within this 
      population. The objective of this study was to characterize the gut microbiome 
      taxonomic composition of Mexican pediatric subjects with MetS and T2DM using 
      shotgun metagenomics and analyze the potential relationship with metabolic 
      changes and proinflammatory effects. Paired-end reads of fecal DNA samples were 
      obtained through the Illumina HiSeq X Platform. Statistical analyses and 
      correlational studies were conducted using gut microbiome data and metadata from 
      all individuals. Gut microbial dysbiosis was observed in MetS and T2DM children 
      compared to healthy subjects, which was characterized by an increase in 
      facultative anaerobes (i.e., enteric and lactic acid bacteria) and a decrease in 
      strict anaerobes (i.e., Erysipelatoclostridium, Shaalia, and Actinomyces genera). 
      This may cause a loss of gut hypoxic environment, increased gut microbial 
      nitrogen metabolism, and higher production of pathogen-associated molecular 
      patterns. These metabolic changes may trigger the activation of proinflammatory 
      activity and impair the host's intermediate metabolism, leading to a possible 
      progression of the characteristic risk factors of MetS and T2DM, such as insulin 
      resistance, dyslipidemia, and an increased abdominal circumference. Furthermore, 
      specific viruses (Jiaodavirus genus and Inoviridae family) showed positive 
      correlations with proinflammatory cytokines involved in these metabolic diseases. 
      This study provides novel evidence for the characterization of MetS and T2DM 
      pediatric subjects in which the whole gut microbial composition has been 
      characterized. Additionally, it describes specific gut microorganisms with 
      functional changes that may influence the onset of relevant health risk factors.

TI  - Examining Mexican-Heritage Mothers' Perceptions of Their Children's Weight: 
      Comparison of Silhouette and Categorical Survey Methods.
PG  - 44-52
LID - 10.1089/chi.2019.0015 [doi]
AB  - Background: Failure to recognize children's overweight status by parents may 
      contribute to children's risk for obesity. We examined two methods of measuring 
      mothers' perceptions of children's weight and factors associated with weight 
      perception inaccuracy. Methods: Cross-sectional analyses of clinical and 
      self-report data from 287 Mexican-heritage mother-child dyads. Mothers identified 
      their child's weight category using a scale (e.g., "normal/overweight/obese") and 
      a visual silhouette scale (11 child gender-specific weight-varying images). 
      Children's height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). 
      Chi-square tests examined associations between categorical, silhouette, and BMI 
      percentile categories of children's weight. Bivariate logistic regression 
      analyses examined factors associated with mothers' inaccuracy of their children's 
      weight. Results: Only 13% of mothers accurately classified their child as obese 
      using the categorical scale, while 78% accurately classified their child as obese 
      using the silhouette scale. Mothers were more likely to underestimate their 
      child's weight using BMI categories (62%) compared to using the silhouette scale 
      (23%). Predictors of mothers' underestimation using the categorical method were 
      child sex [female] (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.02-3.86), child 
      age [younger age] (AOR = 10.39; 95% CI: 4.16-25.92 for ages 5-6 years), and 
      mother's weight status (overweight AOR = 2.99; 95% CI: 1.05-8.51; obese 
      AOR = 5.19; 95% CI: 1.89-14.18). Child BMI was the only predictor of mothers' 
      overestimation (AOR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.85-0.94) using the silhouette method. 
      Conclusions: Using silhouette scales to identify children's body weight may be a 
      more accurate tool for clinicians and interventionists to activate parents' 
      awareness of unhealthy weight in children compared to using traditional 
      categorical weight-labeling methods.

TI  - Relative Weight Gain Through Age 4 Years Is Associated with Increased Adiposity, 
      and Higher Blood Pressure and Insulinemia at 4-5 Years of Age in Mexican 
      Children.
PG  - 1135-1143
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxy068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid early weight gain has been associated with increased risk of 
      obesity and cardiometabolic alterations, but evidence in low and middle-income 
      countries is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the relation between relative 
      weight gain from 1 to 48 mo with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk factors at 
      4-5 y of age, and determined if adiposity is a mediator for cardiometabolic 
      alterations. METHODS: We studied 428 Mexican children with anthropometric and 
      blood pressure (BP) information from birth to 5 y of age from POSGRAD (Prenatal 
      Omega-3 fatty acid Supplementation and child GRowth And Development), of whom 334 
      provided measures of adiposity and cardiometabolic risk markers at 4 y. We 
      estimated relative weight gain by means of conditional weight-for-height z scores 
      for the age intervals 1-6, 6-12, 12-24, and 24-48 mo. Associations between 
      relative weight gain and adiposity and cardiometabolic risk markers (lipid 
      profile, triglycerides, insulin, glucose, and BP) were analyzed by multivariate 
      multiple linear models and path analysis. RESULTS: A 1-unit increase in 
      conditional weight-for-height z score within each age interval was positively 
      associated with adiposity at 5 y, with coefficients of 0.43-0.89 for body mass 
      index (BMI) z score, 1.08-3.65 mm for sum of skinfolds, and 1.21-3.87 cm for 
      abdominal circumference (all P < 0.01). Positive associations were documented 
      from ages 6 to 48 mo with systolic BP (coefficient ranges: 1.19-1.78 mm Hg; all 
      P < 0.05) and from ages 12 to 48 mo with diastolic BP (1.28-0.94 mm Hg; P < 0.05) 
      at 5 y. Conditional weight-for-height z scores at 12-24 and 24-48 mo of age were 
      more strongly associated with adiposity and BP relative to younger ages. A unit 
      increase in conditional weight-for-height z scores from 12 to 24 mo was 
      associated with 14% higher insulin levels (P < 0.05) at 4 y. Path analyses 
      documented that the associations of conditional weight gain with BP were mediated 
      by BMI and sum of skinfolds. CONCLUSION: Relative weight gain at most periods 
      during the first 4 y of life was associated with greater adiposity and higher 
      systolic and diastolic BP at 5 y. These associations with BP were mediated by 
      adiposity. Relative weight gain from 12 to 24 mo was associated with increased 
      serum insulin concentrations at 4 y, but there were no associations with lipid 
      profiles or glucose concentration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This intervention sought to promote healthy eating with the ultimate 
      goal of reducing childhood obesity risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and 
      sixty-one Latino families living on the US-Mexico border with at least one child 
      between 7-13 years of age were eligible to participate. Families randomly 
      assigned to the four-month intervention received 14 contacts with a promotora 
      (community health worker), consisting of 11 home visits and three telephone 
      calls; the control condition was a delayed treatment intervention. Children 
      reported on their dietary intake at baseline, immediately post-intervention and 
      at the six month follow-up visit. RESULTS: The intervention reduced weekly 
      consumption of fast food (p<0.05). A dose-response relationship was observed such 
      that for every seven hours of promotora contact, monthly variety of fruits 
      (p<0.01) and vegetables (p<0.01) increased by one. No other intervention effects 
      were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Family-based interventions can improve children's 
      eating habits, with the amount of contact with the promotora being key to 
      success.

AB  - Introduction: obesity in the pediatric population is a public health problem. The 
      correlation of uric acid and carotid intima media thickness in adults has been 
      demonstrated. Objective: to identify the correlation of uric acid and carotid 
      intima media thickness in adolescents with obesity. Material and methods: an 
      observational, cross-sectional study was carried out. Patients aged ten to 16 
      years with a diagnosis of obesity were included. Uric acid, lipid profile and 
      carotid intima media thickness were determined. In relation to the statistical 
      analysis, carotid intima media thickness was correlated with uric acid levels 
      through Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results: one hundred and sixty-nine 
      adolescents were included with a median age of 13 years, without predominance of 
      sex. A positive correlation of uric acid with carotid intima media thickness was 
      identified (r = 0.242, p = 0.001). When stratified according to sex, there was no 
      correlation in women (r = -0.187, p = 0.074), while in men it increased (r = 
      0.36, p = 0.001) and by pubertal stage, pubertal male adolescents had a positive 
      correlation (p = 0.384, p = 0.002). Conclusion: a weak positive correlation was 
      identified between carotid intimal thickness and uric acid in obese adolescents.

AB  - Delivery methods during childbirth and their related gut microbiota profiles have 
      important impacts on health later in life, they can contribute to the development 
      of diseases such as obesity, whose highest prevalence rate is found among the 
      Mexican child population. Coincidentally, Mexico has one of the highest global 
      average annual rate increase in cesarean births (C-section). Since Mexico leads 
      the world in childhood obesity, studying the relationship between childbirth 
      delivery methods and gut microbiota profiles in this vulnerable population may be 
      used to identify early risk factors for obesity in other developed and developing 
      countries. The objective of this study is to determine the association between 
      child delivery method and gut microbiota profiles in healthy Mexican 
      newborns.Fecal samples of 57 term infants who participated in a randomized 
      clinical trial in 2013 to study the safety of Agave fructans in newborns, were 
      used in this study. DNA samples were extracted and used to characterize the 
      microbiota composition using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The 
      samples were further divided based on childbirth delivery method, as well as 
      early diet. Gut microbiota profiles were determined and analyzed using cluster 
      analysis followed by multiple correspondence analysis.An unusual high abundance 
      of Proteobacteria was found in the gut microbiota of all Mexican infants studied, 
      regardless of delivery method. Feces from infants born by C-section had low 
      levels of Bacteroidetes, high levels of Firmicutes, especially Clostridium and 
      Enterococcus, and a strikingly high ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F:B). 
      Profiles enriched in Bacteroidetes and low F:B ratios, were strongly associated 
      with vaginal delivery.The profile of gut microbiota associated with feces from 
      Mexican infants born by C-section, may be added to the list of boosting factors 
      for the worrying obesity epidemic in Mexico.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An increase in plasma branched-chain amino acids is 
      associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
      diseases. However, little is known about the basal plasma amino acid 
      concentrations in young adults. Our aim was to determine the plasma amino acid 
      profiles of young adults and to evaluate how these profiles were modified by sex, 
      body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance (IR). METHODS AND RESULTS: We 
      performed a transversal study with 608 Mexican young adults aged 19.9 ± 2.4 years 
      who were applicants to the Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí. The subjects 
      underwent a physical examination and provided a clinical history and a blood 
      sample for biochemical, hormonal and amino acid analyses. The women had higher 
      levels of arginine, aspartate and serine and lower levels of α-aminoadipic acid, 
      cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, proline, tryptophan, tyrosine, urea 
      and valine than the men. The obese subjects had higher levels of alanine, 
      aspartate, cysteine, ornithine, phenylalanine, proline and tyrosine and lower 
      levels of glycine, ornithine and serine than the normal weight subjects. Subjects 
      with IR (defined as HOMA > 2.5) had higher levels of arginine, alanine, 
      aspartate, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, proline, tyrosine, taurine and 
      valine than the subjects without IR. Furthermore, we identified two main groups 
      in the subjects with obesity and/or IR; one group was composed of amino acids 
      that positively correlated with the clinical, biochemical and hormonal 
      parameters, whereas the second group exhibited negative correlations. CONCLUSION: 
      This study demonstrates that young adults with obesity or IR have altered amino 
      acid profiles characterized by an increase in alanine, aspartate, proline and 
      tyrosine and a decrease in glycine.

TI  - Adipokines, insulin resistance, and adiposity as a predictors of metabolic 
      syndrome in child survivors of lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia of a 
      developing country.
PG  - 125
LID - 10.1186/s12885-017-3097-8 [doi]
LID - 125
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of evidence indicating that pediatric 
      survivors of cancer are at a greater risk of developing metabolic syndrome. This 
      study evaluated some probable predictors of metabolic syndrome (MS), such as 
      leptin and adiponectin concentrations, the leptin/adiponectin ratio, insulin 
      resistance, and adiposity, in a sample of child survivors of lymphoma and 
      leukemia in Mexico City. METHODS: Fifty two children (leukemia n = 26, lymphoma 
      n = 26), who were within the first 5 years after cessation of therapy, were 
      considered as eligible to participate in the study. Testing included fasting 
      insulin, glucose, adipokines and lipids; body fat mass was measured by DXA. The 
      MS components were analyzed according to tertiles of adipokines, insulin 
      resistance, and adiposity. Comparisons between continuous variables were 
      performed according to the data distribution. The MS components were analyzed 
      according to tertiles of adipokines, insulin resistance, and adiposity. With the 
      purpose of assessing the risk of a present MS diagnosis, odds ratios (OR) with a 
      95% confidence interval (95% IC) were obtained using logistic regression analysis 
      according to the various metabolic markers. RESULTS: The median children age was 
      12.1 years, and the interval time from the completion of therapy to study 
      enrollment was 4 years. Among the MS components, the prevalence of HDL-C low was 
      most common (42%), followed by central obesity (29%). The HOMA-IR (OR 9.0, 95% CI 
      2.0; 41.1), body fat (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.6; 19.3), leptin level (OR 5.7, 95% CI 
      1.6; 20.2) and leptin/adiponectin ratio (OR 9.4, 95% CI 2.0; 49.8) in the highest 
      tertile, were predictive factors of developing MS; whereas the lowest tertile of 
      adiponectin was associated with a protective effect but not significant. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers such as HOMA-IR, leptin and leptin/adiponectin are 
      associated with each of the components of the MS and with a heightened risk of 
      suffering MS among children survivors of cancer. Given the close relationship 
      between MS with risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, it 
      is imperative to implement prevention measures in this population and especially 
      in developing countries where these pathologies have become the leading cause of 
      death.

TI  - A Multi-Component Educational Intervention for Addressing Levels of Physical 
      Activity and Sedentary Behaviors of Schoolchildren.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20043003 [doi]
LID - 3003
AB  - Physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle are risk factors for excess weight 
      and obesity in childhood. It is, therefore, necessary to adopt strategies which 
      can modify these behaviors during childhood, the age at which habits are formed. 
      This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention using 
      digital media and face-to-face activities involving children, parents, and the 
      school community on the level of physical activity and sedentary behavior among 
      schoolchildren. This was a secondary analysis of data obtained from a community 
      trial in which students from four primary schools in Mexico City participated. 
      Two schools were assigned to the intervention group (IG) and two to the control 
      group (CG). The intervention lasted 12 months and included a face-to-face 
      component, which involved sessions and workshops for parents and children, as 
      well as visual material for children and a distance component utilizing 
      electronic means (web portal and text messages to mobile phones) for parents. 
      Anthropometric measurements were taken and information was collected on moderate 
      to vigorous physical activity performed by the children and on the time that the 
      schoolchildren spent in front of screens at the beginning of the study and at 6 
      and 12 months. Information on 201 children from the IG and 167 children from the 
      CG was included in the analysis. At 12 months, the IG showed a mean decrease of 
      33.4 min/d [95% CI: -53.5 to -13.3] in screen time, while the CG showed an 
      increase of 12.5 min/d [CI 95%: -10.5 to 35.6], p = 0.003. After 12 months of 
      follow-up, applying this educational intervention reduced the time that 
      schoolchildren spent in front of screens. Educational intervention is a feasible 
      and accessible strategy for promoting changes in sedentary behaviors in the 
      school-age population.

TI  - Quality of life in pediatric patients with asthma with or without obesity: a 
      pilot study.
PG  - 259-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: In addition to the increased incidence of asthma, obesity in 
      asthmatic children is also on the rise. Several studies have been performed to 
      determine whether obesity could be a risk factor for asthma, but this association 
      has not been demonstrated in all patients. The Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life 
      Questionnaire (PAQLQ) is a standardized and validated tool for use in the 
      pediatric population, which evaluates the effect of asthma on patients' daily 
      activities. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the effect of obesity and 
      overweight on quality of life, the PAQLQS was applied to 100 pediatric patients 
      with intermittent asthma and mild persistent asthma and obesity, overweight and 
      normal weight. The results of the three dimensions evaluated in the questionnaire 
      (emotions, symptoms and limitation of activities) showed significant differences 
      in quality of life in the obese asthmatic group only (p < 0.000). No differences 
      were found when the groups with and without overweight were compared. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The PAQLQ revealed a significant difference in the quality of life 
      in obese asthmatic patients. Overweight and normal weight had no effect quality 
      of life.

TI  - Low Serum Vitamin D Concentrations Are Associated with Insulin Resistance in 
      Mexican Children and Adolescents.
LID - 10.3390/nu11092109 [doi]
LID - 2109
AB  - Previous studies in the Mexican adult population have suggested a relationship 
      between low levels of serum concentrations of serum vitamin D with impaired 
      glucose tolerance, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, regardless of the presence 
      of obesity. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between 
      serum vitamin D levels and the factors linked to insulin resistance. A total of 
      533 children and adolescents from the "Reference Values of Body Composition in 
      the Pediatric Population of Mexico City" study are assessed. Body composition, 
      dietary, and lifestyle data are obtained. Serum vitamin D, insulin, and glucose 
      are also measured. Associations are tested using multiple linear and logistic 
      regression models. Approximately 90% of children and adolescents in this study 
      have sub-optimal vitamin D levels (<30 ng/mL). An inverse relationship between 
      insulin resistance and serum vitamin D is observed (OR (odds ratios) = 2.9; 95% 
      CI (95% confidence intervals): 1.1, 7.2; p-trend 0.03). Low serum vitamin D 
      levels are associated with insulin resistance in the pediatric population. The 
      present study provides additional evidence for the role of vitamin D in insulin 
      resistance. Our findings suggest the supplementation of vitamin D may be helpful 
      in preventing insulin resistance and subsequent diabetes.

TI  - [Pediatric laparoscopic cholecystectomy].
PG  - 275-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We undertook this study to evaluate the results of surgical treatment 
      of symptomatic cholelithiasis through laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a series of 
      47 consecutive pediatric patients. METHODS: During a 5-year period (2001-2005) we 
      performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 47 patients <18 years old in one 
      institution by the same surgical team. The population was comprised of 41 girls 
      and 6 boys (age range: 6-18 years). All had symptomatic cholelithiasis confirmed 
      at ultrasound examination. Associated pathology was studied in each case. The 
      surgical procedure consisted of a four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy under 
      CO(2) pneumoperitoneum. No other concomitant procedure was performed in any case. 
      RESULTS: Median age was 14.6 years old. The youngest patient of the series had a 
      hematological disease. In girls we identified obesity in 62.5% of patients, with 
      a body mass index (BMI) of 26.6 kg/m(2) (SD 3.0) vs. 21.5 kg/m(2) (SD 3.0) in 
      boys (p <0.05), 30% of the girls had a positive medical history for pregnancies 
      (range 1-3) and 15% regularly used oral contraceptives. All cases were 
      symptomatic and 13% suffered from acute biliary pancreatitis. Average surgical 
      time was 59.8 min, the conversion rate was 2.1% and the most frequent surgical 
      complication was gallbladder rupture. No major morbidity was observed as well as 
      no mortality. Postoperatively, all patients were asymptomatic, with a minimum 
      follow-up time of 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was highly 
      effective in cases of symptomatic cholelithiasis. Etiologically, females showed 
      risk factors for cholelithiasis similar to those usually observed in adults. 
      Probably in the near future the incidence of cholelithiasis will increase in this 
      age group. Pediatric surgeons should be familiarized with the minimal access 
      technique to treat this disease.

TI  - Childhood body mass is positively associated with cesarean birth in Yucatec Maya 
      subsistence farmers.
LID - 10.1002/ajhb.22920 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The epidemiologic link between cesarean birth and childhood obesity is 
      unresolved, partly because most studies come from industrialized settings where 
      many post-birth factors affect the risk for obesity. We take advantage of an 
      unusual ethnographic situation where hospital and cesarean birth modes have 
      recently been introduced among Yucatec Maya subsistence farmers, but young 
      children have had minimal exposure to the nutritional transition. While we expect 
      to find very low rates of childhood obesity, we predict that cesarean-born 
      children will be larger and heavier than vaginally born children. METHODS: Weight 
      and height were collected monthly on 108 children aged 0-5 (3576 observations 
      total). Birth mode and birthweight were collected by maternal interview. Data 
      were analyzed using linear mixed models that compare child growth [Maya 
      population-specific Z-scores for weight-for-age and body mass index-for-age (WAZ 
      and BMIZ)] in cesarean and vaginally born children aged 0-5 years. RESULTS: The 
      cesarean rate was 20%, no children were obese, and 5% were overweight. Cesarean 
      birth was a significant predictor of child WAZ and BMIZ after accounting for 
      maternal effects, child birthweight, and sex. Children who were born by cesarean 
      to mothers with high BMI had the highest WAZ of all children by 5 years of age, 
      and the highest BMIZ of all children at all ages. CONCLUSION: Cesarean-born Maya 
      children had higher BMI than vaginally born children, even in the absence of many 
      known confounding factors that contribute to childhood obesity. Child growth was 
      most sensitive to birth mode when mothers had high BMI.

TI  - DIAGNOSIS OF METABOLIC SYNDROME IN CHILDREN AS A POTENTIAL INDICATOR OF TECHNICAL 
      ABILITY IN MEDICAL AND NUTRITIONAL CARE.
PG  - 2105-10

AB  - BACKGROUND: currently, there is an increase in the incidence of obesity in the 
      pediatric population, which is associated with an increase in metabolic syndrome 
      (MetS). Thus, an early diagnosis of MetS is needed in this population to improve 
      the prevention of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in adulthood. 
      OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study was to explore the ability of health 
      professionals to identify the main criteria for MetS in children, which is 
      required for establishing the conditions for early diagnosis and timely 
      treatment. METHODS: a cross-sectional study was conducted using a survey and 
      conducted in two states of the republic (Aguascalientes and Hidalgo) and in the 
      Federal District from January to December 2014. RESULTS: the questionnaire was 
      applied to 274 health professionals. Most of these professionals (61.7%) reported 
      knowledge of the criteria for MetS diagnosis in children and adolescents. 
      Additionally, it was observed that 63.1% of professionals did not perform the 
      needed measurements the waist of circumference in preschool children and that 
      46.4% did not measure them in school children. However, 64.6% of professionals 
      performed the measurements in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: this study found that 
      health professionals providing care to pediatric patients do not know the 
      parameters and cutoff points for MetS diagnosis. They do not conduct a deliberate 
      search for MetS risk factors, which is a major limitation for diagnosis and early 
      treatment. Therefore, we suggest a systematic approach for maintaining the 
      standards of health professionals and to make determining the criteria for proper 
      diagnosis of MetS a target of clinical practice.

TI  - Usual Dietary Energy Density Distribution Is Positively Associated with Excess 
      Body Weight in Mexican Children.
PG  - 1524-30
LID - 10.3945/jn.114.206359 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies suggest a positive association between dietary energy density 
      (DED) and body weight in adults, but evidence in children is inconclusive. 
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare usual DED distributions of 
      nonoverweight vs. overweight or obese (OW/O) Mexican children. METHODS: The study 
      used 24-h recall (24HR) data from 2367 children aged 5-11 y from the 2012 Mexican 
      National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT 2012). Repeated 24HR measures were 
      obtained in a random sample (∼10%) to estimate usual intake distributions by 
      using the Iowa State University (PC-Side) method. Implausible dietary reports 
      were identified. Multivariate linear regression models were used to evaluate the 
      relation between DED and body mass index status and to compare results with and 
      without PC-Side adjustment and restriction to plausible reporters. RESULTS: A 
      total of 35.1% of the children in the sample were OW/O. The usual DED mean was 
      ∼175 kcal/100 g in both the complete sample and the plausible reporters 
      subsample. Regression models adjusted by PC-Side and for potential confounders 
      showed higher DED in OW/O relative to nonoverweight children for both plausible 
      reporters (9.7 kcal/100 g; n = 1452, P < 0.0001) and the complete sample (7.9 
      kcal/100 g; n = 2367, P < 0.0001). The DED difference in plausible reporters 
      translates into 88 additional kilocalories in daily energy intake of OW/O 
      children. In the absence of PC-side adjustment, the difference was significant 
      for plausible reporters (P < 0.05) but not for the complete sample (P > 0.10). 
      CONCLUSIONS: A positive association between usual DED and OW/O was found in 
      Mexican children. The association was stronger when only plausible reporters were 
      considered. This suggests that there is a need for strategies to reduce energy 
      density in the diet of Mexican children.

TI  - The Economic Impact of Lower Protein Infant Formula for the Children of 
      Overweight and Obese Mothers.
LID - 10.3390/nu8010018 [doi]
LID - 18
AB  - The global prevalence of obesity is rising rapidly, highlighting the importance 
      of understanding risk factors related to the condition. Childhood obesity, which 
      has itself become increasingly prevalent, is an important predictor of adulthood 
      obesity. Studies suggest that the protein content consumed in infanthood is an 
      important predictor of weight gain in childhood, which may contribute to higher 
      body mass index (BMI). For instance, there is evidence that a lower protein 
      infant formula (lpIF) for infants of overweight or obese mothers can offer 
      advantages over currently-used infant formulas with regard to preventing 
      excessive weight gain. The current study used health economic modelling to 
      predict the long-term clinical and economic outcomes in Mexico associated with 
      lpIF compared to a currently-used formula. A discrete event simulation was 
      constructed to extrapolate the outcomes of trials on the use of formula in 
      infanthood to changes in lifetime BMI, the health outcomes due to the changes in 
      BMI and the healthcare system costs, productivity and quality of life impact 
      associated with these outcomes. The model predicts that individuals who receive 
      lpIF in infancy go on to have lower BMI levels throughout their lives, are less 
      likely to be obese or develop obesity-related disease, live longer, incur fewer 
      health system costs and have improved productivity. Simulation-based economic 
      modelling suggests that the benefits seen in the short term, with the use of lpIF 
      over a currently-used formula, could translate into considerable health and 
      economic benefits in the long term. Modelling over such long timeframes is 
      inevitably subject to uncertainty. Further research should be undertaken to 
      improve the certainty of the model.

TI  - Effect of malnutrition during the first year of life on adult plasma insulin and 
      glucose tolerance.
PG  - 1005-11
AB  - There is evidence linking intrauterine growth retardation with increased 
      cardiovascular risk and diabetes mellitus (DM) later in life. However, little is 
      known about the association between malnutrition during the first year of life 
      and metabolic abnormalities in adulthood. The objective of this study was to 
      assess the effect of documented malnutrition during the first year of life on 
      glucose tolerance, plasma insulin, lipid profile, and blood pressure in early 
      adulthood, as well as to assess the interaction between body mass index (BMI) and 
      malnutrition on these variables. A study group of young men with a documented 
      history of malnutrition during their first year of life was recruited from 4 
      pediatric hospitals in Mexico City and compared with a control group. Subjects 
      included were 52 men, aged 20.2 +/- 3.6 years, with a mean birth weight of 3.0 
      +/- 0.7 kg and documented malnutrition in their first year of life; controls were 
      50 men, aged 23.3 +/- 1.8 years, with a mean birth weight of 3.2 +/- 0.5 kg. 
      Insulin and glucose concentrations, fasting and in response to an oral glucose 
      load, plasma lipids, blood pressure, and an insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were 
      measured. The areas under the curves of glucose (AUCG) and insulin (AUCI) were 
      significantly higher in cases (P =.012 and <.002, respectively), independent of 
      birth weight, BMI, or age. BMI was significantly associated with fasting plasma 
      insulin (FPI), AUCI, ISI, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein 
      (HDL)-cholesterol concentrations in cases, but not in controls. These data 
      suggest that early malnutrition in extrauterine life, independently of birth 
      weight, has an adverse effect on insulin metabolism and glucose tolerance in 
      young men, and it worsens as body mass increases even within the normal range of 
      BMI. Therefore, it is advisable to prevent obesity in individuals exposed to 
      early malnutrition.

TI  - DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE MEASUREMENTS FOR PREDICTING 
      CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK IN MEXICAN CHILDREN.
PG  - 1170-1176
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The accumulation of abdominal fat is associated with cardiometabolic 
      abnormalities. Waist circumference (WC) measurements allow an indirect evaluation 
      of abdominal adiposity. However, controversy exists over which WC reference 
      values are the most suitable for identifying the pediatric population at risk. 
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of various WC indices to 
      identify abdominal obesity as diagnostic tools for predicting cardiometabolic 
      risk in Mexican children and adolescents. METHODS: Anthropometric measurements 
      were performed and biochemical profiles determined in a crosssectional study that 
      included 366 children and adolescents. Four parameters were used to evaluate 
      abdominal obesity in our study group: (1) WC >90th percentile, according to the 
      Fernández reference in a Mexican-American population measured by the National 
      Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) technique; (2) WC >90th percentile, according 
      to the Klünder reference in a Mexican population (measured by the World Health 
      Organization [WHO] technique); (3) waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) >0.5 according to 
      WHO; and (4) WHtR >0.5 according to NCHS. The ability of each of the indices to 
      discriminate cardiometabolic abnormalities (fasting plasma glucose, dyslipidemia, 
      and hypertension) was assessed. RESULTS: WHtR >0.5 according to WHO or NCHS 
      references showed greater sensitivity to detect metabolic abnormalities compared 
      to percentile reference parameters (74.3 to 100% vs. 59.0 to 88.9%; P<.05). 
      However, the percentiles displayed more specificity to identify these alterations 
      (46.2 to 62.2 vs. 21.3 to 46.9; P<.05). Area under the curve analysis showed that 
      WHtR >0.5 can more readily detect hypertriglyceridemia (0.642), 
      hypoalphalipoproteinemia (0.700), and a combination of two or more metabolic 
      abnormalities (0.661), whereas WC >90th percentile, according to Klünder, better 
      detected hyperglycemia (0.555). CONCLUSION: WHtR >0.5 is a sensitive measure to 
      identify pediatric patients with cardiometabolic alterations, despite its low 
      specificity, and is a useful diagnostic tool to detect populations at risk. Based 
      on the results of this study, we recommend preferential use of the Klünder waist 
      circumference references over the Fernández method in Mexican pediatric 
      populations. ABBREVIATIONS: AUC = area under the curve BMI = body mass index HDL

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome (MS), its components 
      and its association with obesity and cardiovascular risk in school age children. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1,017 children from 6 to 12 
      years of age. Anthropometric information, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, 
      cholesterol, HDLc, LDLc and triglycerides were collected. The presence of MS and 
      its components were determined by criteria of Cook et. al. (2003), modified for 
      children and adolescents. In the analysis, the children were grouped by aged 
      group of 6 to 9 and 10 to 12 years. The association between MS, obesity and 
      cardiovascular risk was estimated using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test, 
      Chi-square test and logistic regression. RESULTS: The MS was present with 54.6% 
      in obese children. Obesity was the characteristic of greater association to 
      suffer from MS with an OR=8.62 p<0.001. CONCLUSIONS: MS is high among children 
      with obesity, and is mostly associated with insulin resistance and atherogenic 
      risk.

TI  - Common predictors of excessive adiposity in children from a region with high 
      prevalence of overweight.
PG  - 227-32
LID - 10.1159/000140514 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To identify risk factors other than energy intake or expenditure that can 
      predict adiposity and overweight in children from a region with high prevalence 
      of obesity. METHODS: We studied 551 children aged 6-12 years (50.5% girls) from a 
      city in the North of Mexico. Tetrapolar bioimpedance was used to assess body fat 
      content. Overweight was estimated by analysis of age- and gender-standardized 
      body mass index (BMI) relative to reference data of the International Obesity 
      Task Force (BMIs that predict obesity in adulthood). Multivariate analyses were 
      modeled to find independent predictors of adiposity. RESULTS: The frequency of 
      overweight/obesity was 37.6%. There were no differences between genders with 
      respect to weight, height and BMI; however, age-standardized percentage of body 
      fat and a sedentary lifestyle were higher in girls than in boys (p < 0.001). 
      Independent predictors of overweight/obesity were having first-degree relatives 
      with obesity [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      1.40-3.64], sedentary lifestyle (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.05-2.37) and being the third 
      child or younger in offspring (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.02-2.47). Predictors of body fat 
      in the highest quartile of the sample were having first-degree relatives with 
      obesity (OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.41-4.74), female gender (OR 5.60, 95% CI 3.22-9.77) 
      and being the third child or younger in offspring (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.22-3.51). 
      These effects could not be explained by social class, ethnicity, maternal age and 
      duration of breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors easily identified by 
      history-taking can predict childhood adiposity and the high risk of obesity in 
      adulthood. Having a first-degree relative with obesity underscores the impact of 
      genes and the family lifestyle on excessive adiposity. Being the third child or 
      younger may denote different nurture practices in offspring; however, this factor 
      deserves more exploration.

TI  - Comparison of leptin levels in neonates born to mothers with high or low 
      gestational weight gain.
PG  - 517-523
LID - 10.1515/jpem-2019-0356 [doi]
AB  - Background Gestational weight gain (GWG) influences both fetal and maternal 
      health. Leptin is a biomarker that may predict the early development of obesity 
      and greater weight gain in childhood. Newborns with higher neonatal weight have 
      been found to have higher leptin levels in umbilical cord blood (UCB). There are 
      few studies that evaluate leptin levels in UCB according to GWG in women with a 
      normal body mass index (BMI). The aim of the present study was to determine 
      whether the levels of leptin in UCB in neonates born to mothers with a high GWG 
      were higher, compared with levels in newborns whose mothers had a low GWG. 
      Methods A cross-sectional analytic study was conducted on 65 primigravidas. They 
      were under 30 years of age, had normal pregestational BMIs, no associated 
      diseases and were classified as having high (n = 22) or low (n = 43) GWG. The 
      neonatal UCB leptin levels were measured and both neonatal and maternal 
      anthropometric evaluations were carried out. The quantitative variables were 
      compared through the Mann-Whitney U test and Student's t test, as appropriate. 
      Results UCB leptin levels were higher in the neonates whose mothers were in the 
      high GWG group, compared with those born to mothers in the low GWG group (7.0 
      [1.9-11.4] vs. 2.9 [1.2-6.7] ng/mL, p = 0.020). When stratified by sex, that 
      difference was maintained only in male neonates. Conclusions UCB leptin levels 
      were higher in neonates born to mothers with a high GWG, compared with those in 
      newborns whose mothers had a low GWG.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the physical and metabolic characteristics of children 
      diagnosed with fatty liver disease in a gastroenterology clinic in El Paso, 
      Texas. DATA SOURCES: A retrospective chart review of 31 patients aged 8-18 
      diagnosed with fatty liver was conducted. CONCLUSIONS: These children were 
      diagnosed with fatty liver by elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels 
      (mean ALT levels 126 +/- 08 U/L) and increased hepatic echogenicity measured via 
      ultrasound. The majority of children were adolescents (12-17 years of age) and 
      Mexican American. All subjects were overweight (body mass index [BMI] > or = 95th 
      percentile) based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards. In a 
      subset of children for whom results from laboratory test were available, we found 
      40% had high triglycerides (> or = 150 mg/dL), 53% had low high-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (< or = 35 mg/dL), and 17% had prediabetes (fasting 
      glucose > or = 100 mg/dL). The clinical and laboratory findings in this patient 
      population with fatty liver are consistent with a diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty 
      liver disease (NAFLD). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Despite the increasing trend in 
      overweight among children and adolescents, data suggest low rates of diagnosis 
      and management of overweight and related comorbidities by healthcare providers. 
      Overweight has been associated with fatty liver disease in the pediatric 
      population and includes other comorbidities such insulin resistance and features 
      of metabolic syndrome. Screening for overweight in children should constitute the 
      first step in identifying children at risk for NAFLD. Nurse practitioners should 
      include in the evaluation of pediatric patients calculation of BMI and waist 
      circumference for age and screening for other overweight-related comorbidities.

PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.22326 [doi]
AB  - The effect of altitude of residence on the growth status of 11,454 indigenous 
      school children 6-14 years of age in Oaxaca, southern Mexico, was examined. 
      Indicators of living conditions (human development index [HDI], index of 
      community nutritional risk [INR], index of marginalization [IM], index of 
      relative isolation [II]) were regressed on z-scores for height, weight and BMI, 
      and the residuals were regressed on altitude of residence (km). Independent of 
      other environmental conditions, altitude negatively affected height by 
      approximately -0.07 z-scores per kilometer altitude above sea level. The 
      estimated average decrease in stature was 0.92 cm per kilometer elevation. BMI 
      was significantly increased, 1.2 units per kilometer elevation, consistent with 
      earlier studies of growth status and altitude. In contrast, weight was not 
      affected by altitude of residence. Approximately 36% of the reduction in height 
      and 54% of the increase in BMI were due to altitude effects; the remaining 
      changes in height and BMI were associated with environmental factors reflected in 
      the indices of community well-being considered.

TI  - [Hypertension in children and adolescence].
PG  - S2-82-93
AB  - The epidemic of childhood obesity, the risk of developing left ventricular 
      hypertrophy, and evidence of the early development of atherosclerosis in children 
      would make the detection of and intervention in childhood hypertension important 
      to reduce long-term health risks; however, supporting data are lacking. Secondary 
      hypertension is more common in preadolescent children, with most cases caused by 
      renal disease. Primary or essential hypertension is more common in adolescents 
      and has multiple risk factors, including obesity and a family history of 
      hypertension. Evaluation involves a through history and physical examination, 
      laboratory tests, and specialized studies. Management is multifaceted. 
      Nonpharmacologic treatments include weight reduction, exercise, and dietary 
      modifications. Although the evidence of first line therapy for hypertension is 
      still controversial, the recommendations for pharmacologic treatment are based on 
      symptomatic hypertension, evidence of end-organ damage, stage 2 of hypertension, 
      or stage 1 of hypertension unresponsive to lifestyle modifications, and 
      hypertension with diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Parents perception of weight status of Mexican preschool children using different 
      tools.
PG  - 382-8
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of parents to estimate the 
      weight status of preschool children attending the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro 
      Social (IMSS) day-care centers using three different tools. A total of 100 
      parent-child pairs attending to all the existing IMSS day-care centers in 
      Ensenada (n = 9) completed a questionnaire on the perception of children's weight 
      status using verbal description, sketches, and pictures. Chi squared test and 
      univariate logistic regression was applied to assess the difference in perception 
      between the tools used, the factors associated with the weight status perception 
      and to identify predictors of parental underestimation of their child's weight. 
      The sample size was estimated for a significance level of 0.05 with statistical 
      power of 80%. No significant differences were found in the perception of weight 
      status using different tools. The parents' underestimation of the child's weight 
      status ranged from 51 to 59%, this percentage jumps to 79 to 84% in overweight 
      children and 82 to 91% in obese children. Being a young mother and having a 
      daughter increased the risk of underestimation. Higher odds of underestimation 
      were found in > 2BMI z-score. The high underestimation found in this study shows 
      that the ability of parents in signaling an alert to prevent childhood obesity 
      might be highly reduced and preventive health programs should include increasing 
      the weight status perception.

TI  - Association of the Triglyceride/High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Index with 
      Insulin Resistance in a Pediatric Population in Northeast Mexico.
PG  - 333-340
LID - 10.1089/met.2020.0046 [doi]
AB  - Background: The present study aimed to determine the association of the 
      triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) index with IR in 
      pediatric patients with overweight (OW) and OB, to assess the ability of the 
      TG/HDL-C index to predict IR, and to estimate the prevalence of IR and metabolic 
      syndrome (MetS). Methods: A cross-sectional study comprised 628 Mexican children 
      (2-16 years old) from the OB clinic. IR was estimated using the HOMA-IR index 
      (‡2.5). The modified Adult Treatment Panel III criteria were used to define MetS. 
      Correlation analyses and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were 
      used to assess the association of the TG/HDL-C index with IR and to establish the 
      best cutoff for the TG/HDL-C index. Results: About 79.3% of the children 
      presented IR and 55.4% MetS. Common findings in patients with IR were acanthosis 
      nigricans (94.8%) and a TG/HDL-C index ‡2.27 (70.5%). Considering all the 
      patients with a high TG/HDL-C index, 78.4% presented MetS, and 88.0% IR. The area 
      under the curve-ROC for the ability of the TG/HDL-C index to predict IR was 0.72 
      (P < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 70.5% and specificity of 63.1%. Conclusions: 
      TG/HDL-C index is a feasible alternative to the HOMA-IR index to predict IR in 
      Mexican children with OW or OB. It might be used to identify children with the 
      greatest need for treatment interventions.
